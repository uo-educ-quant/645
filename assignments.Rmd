## General Guidelines

The goal of the assignments is to practice the concepts and vocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the techniques we have discussed. Full requirements for assignments, information on grading, and the late submission policy are discussed in the syllabus.

You may work on your own or with up to two (2) partners. If you choose to work with others, please make sure that you engage in a full, fair, and mutually-agreeable collaboration. Plan, execute, and write-up your analyses together; do not simply divide up the work. 

**Every person should submit the 2 files described below.** If you worked collaboratively, each person can submit the same documents, but each person's submission should include 1) their own name, 2) an indication that the work is joint and the names of your other collaborators, and 3) information on any other individual or resource (outside of class material) you consulted in your responses. 

## Submission format

For each of the 3 assignments and the final project, you are required to submit the following files:  

 - .doc, .html, or .pdf file with your typed responses to the problems and any tables and figures you produce. 
   
 - .Rmd or .R file you used to render tables and figures. Tables may be created in Word, and in that case, do not require accompanying code. 

*Note that specific assignments may have additional submission requirements, which will be listed in assignment instructions.*
