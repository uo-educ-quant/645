#### Submission deadline

TBD

#### Submission format

You are required to submit two files:  

 - An .doc, .html, or .pdf file that includes your typed responses (in your own words and not identical to anybody else's), tables, and/or figures to the problems  
 - The .Rmd or .R file that you used to render the tables and figures in the above doc/html/pdf file. 
 
#### Dataset

Research shows that substance use is heavier among adults if they start early in adolescence. Among adolescents, tobacco is probably the most widely used drugs but the predictive factors related to tobacco use are not fully studied in the literature. In this assignment, you are required to examine a group of adolescents' characteristics, home, school, and social networks and identify some factors that are significantly related to adolescent tobacco use. Your analysis is based on a sample drawn from the Add Health public use data. The sample is limited to 6,504 middle and high school students who participated in wave I inhome survey during 1994-95. 

Key variables in the dataset are detailed below (you're not required to use all of them):

 - *id*, the individual's unique identifier
 - *age*, the individual's age
 - *female*, dummy variable coded one for individuals whose biological sex is female
 - *hispanic*, *white*, *black*, *native*, and *asian* are all dummy variables coded one for individuals whose self-identified race is Hispanic or Latino, White, Black or African American, American Indian or Native American, and Asian or Pacific Islander, respectively
 - *grade*, factor variable indicating the individual's grade (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12)
 - *prtedu* represent the highest years of education of the individual's household parents
 - *health*, the individual's self-report health status; 4=excellent, 3=very good, 2=good, 1=fair, 0=poor
 - *sleepenough*, the individual's self-report rating of whether they get enough sleep; 0=never, 1=just a few times, 2=about once a week, 3=almost every day, 4=every day
 - *repeating*, dummy variable coded one for individuals who ever repeated a grade
 - *skipping*, dummy variable coded one for individuals who ever skipped a grade
 - *oos*, dummy variable coded one for individuals who got at least one out-of-school suspension
 - *expelled*, dummy variable coded one for individuals who were ever expelled
 - *tsr* and *ssr* measure the individual's self-rating on the questions "Are you getting along with your teachers?" and "Are you getting along with other students?"; 0=never, 1=just a few times, 2=about once a week, 3=almost everyday, 4=everyday
 - *eversmoke*, dummy variable coded one if the individual had ever smoked
 - *dayssmoke*, the number of days on which the individual had smoked within the past 30 days

#### Assignment requirements

Note that your outcome variable is *dayssmoke*, the number of days on which the individual had smoked within the past 30 days, but the predictor variables are dependent upon your own research question (for instance, Whether and to what extent is adolescent smoking behavior related to relationship with teachers?). You are encouraged to conduct a brief literature review before developing your own research question . Then draw variables that are essential to your own analysis and drop incomplete observations in your own analytic sample.

Your assignment will be graded based on the following components:

1. Research significance (10% points) 

    + Conduct a brief literature review and develop your research question based on the data availability of the dataset.
    + Write up your reasoning in a short paragraph that is ended with your specified research question.  

2. Analytic sample summary statistics (10% points)

    + Load the dataset and perform basic data management
      + only keep variables that you think will be used in your analysis and drop other variables
      + drop incomplete observations
      + check whether your variables are the right class, if not, convert them to the right type
      + other data management you think fit 
    + Produce a summary statistics table (Table 1)
    + Write a short paragraph describe your sample, key variables, and the summary statistics
 
3. Methods and analysis (30% points)

    + Model the relationship of your interest in a Poisson regression model
      + add covariates and see if your estimates change
    + Write a short paragraph to report the results of each model you fit

4. Poisson regression assumptions and diagnostics (10% points)

    + Check for critical assumptions and outliers
      + supply with plots if necessary
    + Write a short paragraph to report your diagnostics tests

5. Discussions and conclusions (30% points)

    + Put all of your models in a table (Table 2) 
    + Write a short paragraph to compare the models, summarize your findings, and answer your research question

6. References, tables, and figures (10% points)

    + Must include references, Table 1, Tabl 2
    + Other tables and figures you see fit
