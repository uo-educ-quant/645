## Unit 1: Logistic Regression

**Learning Objectives:** 

- Understand the linear probability model and discuss its limitations

- Understand and differentiate the concepts of probability, odds, and logit

- Learn how to use the logistic regression model with continuous and categorical predictors and interpret the model parameters and inference for model parameters

- Apply logistic regression model with an interaction between a continuous and categorical predictor, how to interpret the model parameters, and inference for model parameters

- Apply glm function in R to fit the logistic regression model

- Discuss the predictive power, model fit, and diagnostics for a logistic regression model

## Unit 2: Poisson Regression

**Learning Objectives:** 

- Introduce regression models for analyzing count and rates

-	Describe situations which merit the use of Poisson regression

-	State the assumptions about rates in Poisson regression

- Introduce poisson regression model with continuous and categorical predictors, and how to interpret the model parameters and inference for model parameters

- Introduce the poisson regression model with an interaction between a continuous and categorical predictor, how to interpret the model parameters, and inference for model parameters

- Learn how to apply the glm function in R to fit the poisson regression model

## Unit 3: Introduction to Nested Data

**Learning Objectives:** 

- Introduce the nested data structure (two-level, e.g., repeated measures within individuals, students within schools)

- Students will be able to understand and explain what nesting/clustering means

- Demonstrate varying intercepts and slopes across clusters. Using a dataset, students/instructors can fit the same regression model independently for each cluster and create a table of intercepts and slopes across clusters

- Students will understand what it means for intercepts and slopes to vary across clusters

- Develop/discuss the notion that regression coefficients may vary across different clusters

- Develop the concept of **fixed-effects** as the aggregation of the different intercepts and slopes by taking an average of varying intercept and slopes across clusters

- Develop the concept of **random effects** as the difference between cluster-specific intercept and slope and their averages across clusters

- Develop the concept of the covariance matrix of **random-effects**

- Discuss the implications of ignoring the variance of random-effects in terms of the inference for fixed-effects and statistical power

- Introduce the random intercept-only model, its estimation through the R lmer package, interpret the model parameters and align them with the earlier discussion of fixed-effects
and random-effects.

- Introduce the intra-class correlation as a measure of within-cluster dependency, and how to use it to decide whether one needs to use multilevel modeling

- Finish by emphasizing that this is a very brief introduction of nested data and refer students to the multilevel modeling sequence for a comprehensive treatment of the
subject

- *Time permitting*: Discuss alternatives to multilevel modeling of nested data

## Unit 4: Introduction to Measurement and Assessment

**Learning Objectives:** 

- Introduction to the concept of reliability

- Understand the assumption of underlying shared construct for a set of items in surveys with aggregated scores across items

- Demonstrate how to compute and interpret Cronbach's alpha, and emphasize the strong underlying assumptions

## Unit 5: Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Data

**Learning Objectives:** 

- Students should be ready to talk about the concept of model-based imputation as earlier lectures in the sequence covered linear regression and logistic regression

- Introduce the missing data mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)

- Introduce the concepts of the listwise deletion and pairwise deletion and their potential limitations

- Introduce the single-imputation methods (mean, regression, and stochastic regression imputation)

- Introduce the "missing-value-dummy" method (Cohen) and some issues with this approach

- Introduce the conceptual steps for the multiple-imputation

- Introduce the mice package in R and how to implement multiple-imputation for fitting a regression model to a data set with missing values
