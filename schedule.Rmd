## Unit 3: Nested Data

**Learning Objectives**: 

- Describe nested data structures (two-level, e.g., repeated measures within individuals, students within schools)

- Demonstrate how intercepts, slopes, and regression coefficients may vary across clusters

- Compare and contrast using fixed-effects and random-effects in regression models

- Explain the covariance matrix of random-effects and describe implications of ignoring random-effects in terms of the inference for fixed-effects and statistical power

- Measure within-cluster dependency using intra-class correlation, and describe how to evaluate whether multilevel modeling is appropriate

- Create fixed and random intercept-only models and interpret the model parameters using the R `lmer` package

- *Time permitting*: Discuss alternatives to multilevel modeling of nested data
