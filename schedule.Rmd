## Unit 1: Introduction to Nested Data (Week 1-2)

**Learning Objectives:** 

- Introduce the nested data structure (two-level, e.g., repeated measures within individuals, students within schools)
  - Students will be able to understand and explain what nesting/clustering means

- Demonstrate varying intercepts and slopes across clusters. Using a dataset, students/instructors can fit the same regression model independently for each cluster and create a table of intercepts and slopes across clusters
  - Students will understand what it means for intercepts and slopes to vary across clusters

- Develop/discuss the notion that regression coefficients may vary across different clusters

- Develop the concept of **fixed-effects** as the aggregation of the different intercepts and slopes by taking an average of varying intercept and slopes across clusters

- Develop the concept of **random effects** as the difference between cluster-specific intercept and slope and their averages across clusters

- Develop the concept of the covariance matrix of **random-effects**

- Discuss the implications of ignoring the variance of random-effects in terms of the inference for fixed-effects and statistical power

- Introduce the random intercept-only model, its estimation through the R lmer package, interpret the model parameters and align them with the earlier discussion of fixed-effects
and random-effects.

- Introduce the intra-class correlation as a measure of within-cluster dependency, and how to use it to decide whether one needs to use multilevel modeling

- Finish by emphasizing that this is a very brief introduction of nested data and refer students to the multilevel modeling sequence for a comprehensive treatment of the
subject

- If time permits, there may be a discussion that not all nested data needs multilevel modeling and there are alternative approaches to adjust the standard errors for fixed effects if they are the sole interest

## Unit 2: Logistic Regression (Week 3-4-5)

**Learning Objectives:** 

- Introduce the linear probability model and discuss the limitations

- Introduce the concept of probability, odds, and logit

- Introduce the logistic function

- Introduce the logistic regression model with continuous predictors and how to interpret the model parameters and inference for model parameters

- Introduce the glm function in R to fit the logistic regression model

- Introduce the logistic regression model with categorical predictors and how to interpret the model parameters and inference for model parameters

- Introduce the logistic regression model with an interaction between a continuous and categorical predictor, how to interpret the model parameters, and inference for model parameters

- Discuss the predictive power, model fit, and diagnostics for a logistic regression model

## Unit 4: Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Data (Week 8-9)

**Learning Objectives:** 

- Students should be ready to talk about the concept of model-based imputation as earlier lectures in the sequence covered linear regression and logistic regression

- Introduce the missing data mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)

- Introduce the concepts of the listwise deletion and pairwise deletion and their potential limitations

- Introduce the single-imputation methods (mean, regression, and stochastic regression imputation)

- Introduce the "missing-value-dummy" method (Cohen) and some issues with this approach

- Introduce the conceptual steps for the multiple-imputation

- Introduce the mice package in R and how to implement multiple-imputation for fitting a regression model to a data set with missing values

## Unit 5: Introduction to Measurement and Assessment (Week 10)

**Learning Objectives:** 

- Introduction to the concept of reliability

- Talk about the assumption that there is a single underlying construct for a set of items in surveys when you aggregate scores across items

- Show how to compute Cronbach's alpha, how to interpret it, and emphasize the strong underlying assumptions
