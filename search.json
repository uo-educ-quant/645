Today,\ndescendants are citizens of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde\nCommunity of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of\nOregon, and they continue to make important contributions in their\ncommunities, at UO, and across the land we now refer to as Oregon.\n\n\nI. General Course Information\nEDUC 645: Applied Statistics in Education and Human Services III\n{course subject code}, {CRN}\n3 Credits {Term and year}\nTuesdays and Thursdays, 4:00pm–5:20pm {Classroom location}\nInstructor: * Nicholas Parr {pronouns, email, phone, office location,\noffice hours, preferred method of contact}\n* Claire Zhang {pronouns, email, phone, office location, office hours,\npreferred method of contact}\n* Havisha Khurana {pronouns, email, phone, office location, office\nhours, preferred method of contact}\n\n\nII. Course Overview\nThis course is the third in a sequence intended to provide a toolkit\nof statistical concepts, methods, and their implementation to producers\nof applied research in education, human services, and other social\nsciences. The course is organized around the principle that research\ndesign depends in part on researchers’ substantive questions and their\nquantitative data available to address these questions. In this\nupper-level introductory course, students will learn about and practice\nusing analytic models and strategies that are suitable for examining\ndata that have (a) a nested structure, (b) a dichotomous outcome\nvariable, (c) a count outcome variable, and (d) missing values; they\nwill also learn about when and how to estimate (e) internal consistency\nand interrater reliability for research purposes. The course seeks to\nblend a conceptual, mathematical, and applied understanding of\nintroductory statistical concepts. At the core of our pedagogical\napproach is the belief that students learn statistical analysis by doing\nstatistical analysis. EDUC 643 (or a similar intermediate statistics\ncourse) is a pre-requisite as is a basic familiarity with a statistical\nprogramming language (preferably R).\n\n\nIII. Student Learning Outcomes\nBy the end of this term, it is expected that students will be able\nto:\nDetermine when it is appropriate to use multilevel modeling,\nlogistic regression, and Poisson regression in education and human\nservices.\nConduct and interpret basic multilevel, logistic, and Poisson, and\nmultilevel regression analyses.\nDescribe the assumptions of multilevel, logistic, and Poisson, and\nmultilevel regression analyses and test analytic models for the extent\nto which they satisfy the models’ assumptions.\nExplain and apply the concepts of reliability and agreement in\nmeasurement for research purposes.\nExplain the applications and limitations of different methods for\ntreating missing data.\nImplement modern methods for examining and treating missingness of\ndata in the GLM framework.\nPerform all analyses using an object-oriented, open-source\nprogramming language.\n\n\nIV. Textbooks and Reading Materials\n\nTextbooks\nThere are two required texts:\nRoback, P., & Legler, J. (2021). Beyond multiple linear\nregression: Applied generalized linear models and multilevel models in R\n(1st ed.). CRC Press. https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/\nAlbano, A. D. (2020). Introduction to educational and psychological\nmeasurement using R. https://www.thetaminusb.com/intro-measurement-r/\nWe will primarily be referring to chapters in Roback and Legler’s Beyond Multiple\nLinear Regression (BMLR). We will also rely on a\ncouple of chapters in Albano’s Introduction to\nEducational and Psychological Measurement Using R\n(IEPM) Both textbooks are available for free online.\nYou may choose to purchase a paper copy of BMLR if you wish, but it is\nnot required.\n\n\nSupplemental reading materials\nFurther readings will be provided in the form of peer-reviewed\njournal articles. Links to these papers can be found in the\nschedule.\n\n\nR and RStudio\nStudents must have the latest version of R, which can be downloaded\nhere. It is strongly\nrecommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, available here.\nBoth softwares are free. We will provide tutorials on R/RStudio\ninstallation and they are also accessible here.\n\nResources for R and RStudio\nWhile we will teach you how to effectively use R and RStudio to\nconduct analyses, one of the key skills required to use R is the ability\nto find answers on your own. Many common questions or problems are\neither available on blogs or have been asked and answered in discussion\nforums already. Finding and deciphering those answers is an important\nskill you should seek to hone. You will never remember all of the\nprogramming commands!\nHere are some sites where you can find the answers to many R\nquestions and learn new tricks:\nYaRrr, the\nPirate’s Guide to R by Nathaniel Phillips\nR for Data Science by\nHadley Wickham\nR Cookbook by\nWinston Chang\nAn Introduction to\nStatistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor\nHastie and Robert Tibshirani\nCheat\nSheets\nQuick-R\nStackOverflow\nStack Exchange\n\n\n\n\nIV.

While some may\nfeel that this is overly paternalistic, rResearch evidence shows that\nfrequent quizzing increases learning (see a summary of one\nstudy from the University of Texas). Quizzes will be open book and\nnotes.\n\n\nAssignments\nThe goal of the assignments is to practice the concepts and\nvocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the\ntechniques we have learned. Each assignment has an associated data\nsource, short codebook and detailed instructions for the required data\nand analytic tasks. You may work on your own or collaborate with one (1)\npartner. Please make sure that you engage in a a full, fair and\nmutually-agreeable collaboration if you do choose to collaborate. If you\ndo collaborate, you should plan, execute and write-up your analyses\ntogether, not simply divide the work. Please make sure to indicate\nclearly when your work is joint and any other individual or resource\n(outside of class material) you consulted in your response. Further\nassignment details are available here.\n\n\nFinal\nThe final assignment involves a more extended application and\nsynthesis of the concepts of descriptive and relational applied data\nanalysis covered in this course. # VI. Statement of How Requirements\nDiffer for Undergraduate and Graduate Students\nThis course does not have an undergraduate section.\n\n\n\nVII. Role of Graduate Employees\nIf you are concurrently taking any courses with the graduate employee\n(GE) assigned to this course, please let the instructor know. The GE\nwill not be involved with any review of assignments for students in this\ncourse who are taking other courses concurrently.\n\n\nVIII. Student Engagement Inventory\nGraduate students are expected to perform work of high quality and\nquantity, typically with forty hours of student engagement for each\nstudent credit hour. For this course, the following table shows the\nnumber of hours a typical student would expect to spend in each of the\nfollowing activities:\nEducational activity\nHours\nExplanatory comments\nClass attendance\n30\nThree hours per week over 10 weeks\nClass reading and prep\n30\nIncludes reading and review of slides\nHomework Assignments\n35\nFive assignments taking 7 hours each (on avg.)\nFinal project\n25\nIncludes familiarization with data, data analysis, preparation of\ndisplays and writing\nTotal hours\n120\n\n\n\nIX. Attendance and Absence Guidelines\nAttendance is required. In-person attendance at our scheduled class\nmeetings is expected and is integral to success in the course. In the\ncase of unavoidable absence, students must inform the instructor as\nearly as possible to discuss make-up work. If you need accommodation\nrelated to disability, you can request those by working with the\nAccessible Education Center (https://aec.uoregon.edu).\n\n\nX. Expected Classroom Behavior\nMinimally, we follow the Golden Rule of treating others as we wish to\nbe treated. We must also attend to equity concerns and understand that\neach of us has a unique experience and we vary in our values and\nexpectations.\n\n\nXI. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nIt is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value\nequity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for\nall students. To do so requires that we:\nrespect the dignity and essential worth of all\nindividuals.\npromote a culture of respect throughout the University\ncommunity.\nrespect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.\nreject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any\nkind.\npractice personal and academic integrity and expect it from\nothers.\npromote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is\nthe lifeblood of the university.\nIn this course, class discussions, projects/activities and\nassignments will challenge students to think critically about and be\nsensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity,\nnationality, documentation, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic\nbackground, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and\nother cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged\nto develop or expand their respect and understanding of such\ndifferences. Maintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all\nstudents feel able to talk about their cultural identities and\nexperiences, ideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my\nresponsibility, but the responsibility of each class member as well.\nBehavior that disregards or diminishes another student will not be\npermitted for any reason. This means that no racist, ableist,\ntransphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or otherwise derogatory comments\nwill be allowed. It also means that students must pay attention and\nlisten respectfully to each other’s comments.\n\n\nXII. Using Pronouns and Personal Preference\nThe College of Education is always working to include and engage\neveryone. One way we can do this is to share your pronouns, or the words\nyou want to be called when people aren’t using your name. Like names,\npronouns are an important part of how we identify that deserves to be\nrespected. And we recognize that assuming someone’s gender can be\nhurtful, especially to members of our community who are transgender,\ngenderqueer, or non-binary. As a community, we are all learning together\nabout the importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans\ncommunity on campus. Please discuss the pronouns you wish to be used\nwith your professor to help them be aware of how to address you\nrespectfully. Please visit this university website for more\ninformation.\nhttps://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns\n\n\nXIII. Accessible Education - (see https://aec.uoregon.edu/best-practices-faculty for more\ninformation)\nThe University of Oregon is working to create inclusive learning\nenvironments. Please notify me if there are aspects of the instruction\nor design of this course that result in disability-related barriers to\nyour participation. Participation includes access to lectures, web-based\ninformation, in-class activities, and exams. The Accessible Education\nCenter (http://aec.uoregon.edu/) works with students to provide\nan instructor notification letter that outlines accommodations and\nadjustments to class design that will enable better access. Contact the\nAccessible Education Center in 360 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or uoaec@uoregon.edu for\nassistance with access or disability-related questions or concerns.\n\n\nXIV. Accommodation for Religious Observances\nThe university makes reasonable accommodations, upon request, for\nstudents who are unable to attend a class for religious obligations or\nobservance reasons, in accordance with the university discrimination\npolicy which says “Any student who, because of religious beliefs, is\nunable to attend classes on a particular day shall be excused from\nattendance requirements and from any examination or other assignment on\nthat day. The student shall make up the examination or other assignment\nmissed because of the absence.” To request accommodations for this\ncourse for religious observance, visit the Office of the Registrar’s\nwebsite (https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/religious-observances) and\ncomplete and submit to the instructor the “Student Religious\nAccommodation Request” form prior to the end of the second week of the\nterm.\n\n\nXV. Mental Health and Wellness \nLife at college can be very complicated. Students often feel\noverwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with\nrelationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If\nyou’re facing such challenges, you don’t need to handle them on your\nown–there’s help and support on campus. \nAs your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I\nwill express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you\nto resources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the\ndetails of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I\ncare and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to\ndo—for yourself and those you care about.\nUniversity Health Services help students cope with difficult emotions\nand life stressors. If you need general resources on coping with stress\nor want to talk with another student who has been in the same place\nas you, visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and\nget help from one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates.
