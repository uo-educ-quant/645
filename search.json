General Guidelines\nThe goal of the assignments is to practice the concepts and\nvocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the\ntechniques we have learned. You may work on your own or collaborate with\none (1) partner. Please make sure that you engage in a a full, fair and\nmutually-agreeable collaboration if you do choose to collaborate. If you\ndo collaborate, you should plan, execute and write-up your analyses\ntogether, not simply divide the work. Please make sure to indicate\nclearly when your work is joint and any other individual or resource\n(outside of class material) you consulted in your responses.\n(Here we need to add more details about global expectations and\nrequirements for all the assignments, grading and points distribution\nfor participation, assignments, and/or final project/exam, late\nsubmission policy, etc. from syllabus.)\n\n\n2. Submission format\nFor each of the four assignments as well as the final project, you\nare required to submit two files:\nAn .doc, .html, or .pdf file that includes your typed responses\n(in your own words and not identical to anybody else’s), tables, and/or\nfigures to the problems\nThe .Rmd or .R file that you used to render the tables and\nfigures in the above doc/html/pdf file.\n\n\n3.

This textbook is available for free online. You may choose to\npurchase a paper copy if you wish, but it is not required.\n\nR and RStudio\nStudents must have the latest version of R, which can be downloaded\nhere. It is strongly\nrecommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, available here.\nBoth softwares are free. We will provide tutorials on R/RStudio\ninstallation and they are also accessible here.\n\nResources for R and RStudio\nWhile we will teach you how to effectively use R and RStudio to\nconduct analyses, one of the key skills required to use R is the ability\nto find answers on your own. Many common questions or problems are\neither available on blogs or have been asked and answered in discussion\nforums already. Finding and deciphering those answers is an important\nskill you should seek to hone. You will never remember all of the\nprogramming commands!\nHere are some sites where you can find the answers to many R\nquestions and learn new tricks:\nYaRrr, the\nPirate’s Guide to R by Nathaniel Phillips\nR for Data Science by\nHadley Wickham\nR Cookbook by\nWinston Chang\nAn Introduction to\nStatistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor\nHastie and Robert Tibshirani\nCheat\nSheets\nQuick-R\nStackOverflow\nStack Exchange\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\nFor more details, see here.\nUnits\nWeeks\nTopics\nRequired Readings\nAssignments\nQuizzes\n1\n1 - 3\nLogistic regression\nNA\nAssignment 1\nQuiz 1\n2\n4-5\nPoisson regression\nNA\nAssignment 2\nQuiz 2\n3\n6-8\nNested data\nNA\nAssingment 3\nQuiz 3\n4\n9\nMeasurement and assessment\nNA\nAssignment 4\nQuiz 4\n5\n10\nData cleaning and handling missing data\nNA\nAssignment 5\nQuiz 5\nFinal\n-\n-\n-\nFinal\n-\n\n\nGrading Components and Criteria\nFinal grades will be based on the following components:\nQuizzes: 10% (5 quizzes of 2% each)\nAssignments: 60% (5 assignments of 12% each)\nFinal: 30%\n\nQuizzes\nFive classes will begin with a very short multiple-choice quiz that\nis designed to test your knowledge of the theoretical principles\nunderlying the statistics we are studying for the week. While some may\nfeel that this is overly paternalistic, research evidence shows that\nfrequent quizzing increases learning (see a summary of one\nstudy from the University of Texas). Quizzes will be open book and\nnotes (but not laptop/computer).\n\n\nAssignmnets\nThe goal of the assignments is to practice the concepts and\nvocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the\ntechniques we have learned. Each assignment has an associated data\nsource, short codebook and detailed instructions for the required data\nand analytic tasks. You may work on your own or collaborate with one (1)\npartner. Please make sure that you engage in a a full, fair and\nmutually-agreeable collaboration if you do choose to collaborate. If you\ndo collaborate, you should plan, execute and write-up your analyses\ntogether, not simply divide the work. Please make sure to indicate\nclearly when your work is joint and any other individual or resource\n(outside of class material) you consulted in your response. Further\nassignment details are available here.\n\n\nFinal\n\n\n\nStudent Engagement Inventory\nGraduate students are expected to perform work of high quality and\nquantity, typically with forty hours of student engagement for each\nstudent credit hour. For this course, the following table shows the\nnumber of hours a typical student would expect to spend in each of the\nfollowing activities:\nEducational activity\nHours\nExplanatory comments\nClass attendance\n30\nTBD frequency\nClass reading and prep\n15\nIncludes reading and review of slides\nHomework Assignments\n50\nHomework assignments will take 10 hours each (on avg.)\nFinal\n25\nIncludes familiarization with data, data analysis, preparation of\ndisplays and writing\nTotal hours\n120\nThese are approximations.
