Full requirements for assignments,\ninformation on grading, and the late submission policy are discussed in\nthe syllabus.\nYou may work on your own or with up to two (2) partners. If you\nchoose to work with others, please make sure that you engage in a full,\nfair, and mutually-agreeable collaboration. Plan, execute, and write-up\nyour analyses together; do not simply divide up the work.\nEvery person should submit the 2 files described\nbelow. If you worked collaboratively, each person can submit\nthe same documents, but each person’s submission should include 1) their\nown name, 2) an indication that the work is joint and the names of your\nother collaborators, and 3) information on any other individual or\nresource (outside of class material) you consulted in your\nresponses.\n\n\nSubmission format\nFor each of the 3 assignments and the final project, you are required\nto submit the following files:\n.doc, .html, or .pdf file with your typed responses to the\nproblems and any tables and figures you produce.\n.Rmd or .R file you used to render tables and figures. Tables may\nbe created in Word, and in that case, do not require accompanying\ncode.\nNote that specific assignments may have additional submission\nrequirements, which will be listed in assignment instructions.\n\n\nAssignments\nUnit 1:\nDue April 25\nAssignment\ndetails\nUnit 2:\nDue May 16\nAssignment\ndetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Course Overview\nThis course is the third in a sequence intended to provide a toolkit\nof statistical concepts, methods, and their implementation to producers\nof applied research in education, human services, and other social\nsciences. The course is organized around the principle that research\ndesign and analysis depends on researchers’ substantive questions and\nthe data they have available to address these questions. In this\nintermediate level course, students will learn about and practice using\nanalytic models and strategies that are suitable for examining data that\nhave (a) a dichotomous outcome variable, (b) a count outcome variable,\n(c) a nested structure, and/or (d) missing values. Students will also\nlearn (e) when and how to estimate internal consistency reliability. The\ncourse seeks to blend a conceptual, mathematical, and applied\nunderstanding of introductory statistical concepts. Students will employ\nthese statistical tools in a variety of applications, with a particular\nemphasis on strategies to generate research products relevant to\nculturally and linguistically diverse communities. At the core of our\npedagogical approach is the belief that students learn statistical\nanalysis by doing statistical analysis.\nEDUC 643 (or a similar intermediate statistics course) is a\npre-requisite as is a basic familiarity with a statistical programming\nlanguage (preferably R).\n\n\nIII. Student Learning Outcomes\nBy the end of this term, it is expected that students will be able\nto:\nDetermine when it is appropriate to use logistic regression or\nPoisson regression analyses and analyses that account for nested data in\neducation and human services research.\nConduct and interpret basic logistic and Poisson regression\nanalyses and analyses that account for nested data.\nDescribe the assumptions of logistic and Poisson regression\nanalyses and analyses for nested data, and test analytic models for the\nextent to which they satisfy the models’ assumptions.\nUnderstand the role of reliability in linear models and calculate\ninternal consistency coefficients.\nExplain common mechanisms of missingness and the applications and\nlimitations of different methods for handling missing data.\nAssess missing data characteristics and implement multiple\nimputation to handle missing data.\nUse the above applied statistical tools (alongside others learned\nin prior courses in the EDUC quantitative sequence) to generate research\nthat is relevant to culturally and linguistically diverse\ncommunities.\nPerform all analyses using an object-oriented, open-source\nprogramming language.\n\n\nTextbooks, Reading Materials, and Software\n\nTextbooks\nThe following text and reading materials are required:\nRoback, P., & Legler, J. (2021). Beyond multiple linear\nregression: Applied generalized linear models and multilevel models in R\n(1st ed.). CRC Press. https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/\nDunn, T. J., Baguley, T., & Brunsden V. (2014). From alpha to\nomega: A practical solution to the pervasive problem of internal\nconsistency estimation. British Journal of Psychology, 105, 399–412. https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12046\nLittle, T. D., Jorgensen, T. D., Lang, K. M., & Moore, W. G.\n(2014). On the joys of missing data. Journal of Pediatric Psychology,\n39(2), 151–162. https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jst048\nWe will primarily be referring to chapters in Roback and Legler’s Beyond Multiple\nLinear Regression (BMLR), which is available for\nfree online.\n\n\nSupplemental reading materials\nFurther readings will be provided in the form of peer-reviewed\njournal articles. Links to these papers will be provided in the\nschedule.\n\n\nR and RStudio\nStudents must have the latest version of R, which can be downloaded\nhere. It is strongly\nrecommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, available here.\nBoth are free.\n\nResources for R and RStudio\nWhile this course teaches you how to effectively use R and RStudio to\nconduct analyses, one of the key skills required to use R is the ability\nto find answers on your own. Many common questions or problems are\neither available on blogs or have been asked and answered in discussion\nforums already. Finding and deciphering those answers is an important\nskill you should seek to hone. It is impossible to remember all\nprogramming commands!\nHere are some sites where you can find the answers to many R\nquestions and learn new tricks:\nYaRrr, the\nPirate’s Guide to R by Nathaniel Phillips\nR for Data Science by\nHadley Wickham\nR Cookbook by\nWinston Chang\nAn Introduction to\nStatistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor\nHastie and Robert Tibshirani\nCheat\nSheets\nQuick-R\nStackOverflow\nStack Exchange\n\n\n\n\nIV. Weekly Schedule of Topics, Assignments, and Readings\nSee here.\n\n\nV. Grading Components and Criteria\nGrades will be assigned in accordance with the College of Education\ngrading requirements. Grades are criterion-referenced; that is, each\nstudent’s performance is graded according to the extent to which they\nmeet the course learning and performance criteria and exhibit individual\nlearning. You can check your assignment grades and points on Canvas.\nThe due dates for course assignments and the final are posted here. Late work can receive a grade no\nhigher than a B+ unless an extension has been requested and approved by\nthe instructor before the assignment is due.\nAssignments submitted after the last day of class will be given no\ncredit.\nFinal grades will be based on the following components:\nQuizzes: 15% (3 quizzes at 5% each)\nAssignments: 60% (3 assignments at 20% each)\nFinal Project: 25%\nGrade\nPercentage\nGrade\nPercentage\nA+\n>_ 98%\nC+\n77% to < 80%\nA\n94% to < 98%\nC\n73% to < 77%\nA-\n90% to < 94%\nC-\n70% to < 73%\nB+\n87% to < 90%\nD\n60% to < 70%\nB\n83% to < 87%\nF\n< 60%\nB-\n80% to < 83%\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nEach of the three units will include an open-book/open-note quiz\ntaken on Canvas. Quizzes will cover core concepts discussed in the\ninitial lectures of each unit.\n\n\nAssignments\nThe goal of the assignments is to practice the concepts and\nvocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the\ntechniques we have discussed. Each assignment has an associated data\nsource, short codebook, and detailed instructions for the required data\nand analytic tasks. You may work on your own or collaborate with up to\ntwo (2) partners. Please make sure that you engage in a full, fair, and\nmutually-agreeable collaboration if you do choose to collaborate. If you\ndo collaborate, you should plan, execute, and write-up your analyses\ntogether; do not simply divide up the work. Please make sure to indicate\nclearly when your work is joint and any other individual or resource\n(outside of class material) you consulted in your responses. Further\nassignment details are available on the course website. Further\nassignment details are available here.\nAssignments will be evaluated based on students’ performance in\ncompleting the assignment tasks, showing their work, and in\ndemonstrating their understanding of the course concepts and\nterminology.\n\n\nFinal\nThe final assignment involves a more extended application of methods\ncovered in this course. Instructions for the final assignment will be\nprovided during Week 9 and listed here.\n\n\n\nVI. Statement of How Requirements Differ for Undergraduate and\nGraduate Students\nThis course does not have an undergraduate section.\n\n\nVII. Role of Graduate Employees\nIf you are concurrently taking any courses with the graduate employee\n(GE) assigned to this course, please let the instructor know. The GE\nwill not be involved with any review of assignments for students in this\ncourse who are taking other courses concurrently.\n\n\nVIII. Student Engagement Inventory\nGraduate students are expected to perform work of high quality and\nquantity, typically with forty hours of student engagement for each\nstudent credit hour. For this course, the following table shows the\nnumber of hours a typical student would expect to spend in each of the\nfollowing activities:\nEducational activity\nHours\nExplanatory comments\nClass attendance\n30\nThree hours per week over 10 weeks\nClass reading and prep\n30\nIncludes reading and review of slides\nAssignments\n24\nThree assignments taking 8 hours each (on avg.)\nQuizzes\n5\n1 hour per quiz (40 min preparation, 20 min completing quiz)\nLab attendance\n10\nOne hour-long lab per week over 10 weeks\nFinal project\n21\nIncludes familiarization with data, data analysis, preparation of\ngraphics and writing\nTotal hours\n120\n\n\n\nIX. Attendance and Absence Guidelines\nAttendance is required. In-person attendance at our scheduled class\nmeetings is expected and is integral to success in the course. In the\ncase of unavoidable absence, students must inform the instructor as\nearly as possible to discuss make-up work. If you need accommodation\nrelated to disability, you can request those by working with the\nAccessible Education Center (https://aec.uoregon.edu).\n\n\nX. Expected Classroom Behavior\nMinimally, we follow the Golden Rule of treating others as we wish to\nbe treated. We must also attend to equity concerns and understand that\neach of us has a unique experience and we vary in our values and\nexpectations.\n\n\nXI. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nIt is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value\nequity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for\nall students. To do so requires that we:\nrespect the dignity and essential worth of all\nindividuals.\npromote a culture of respect throughout the University\ncommunity.\nrespect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.\nreject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any\nkind.\npractice personal and academic integrity and expect it from\nothers.\npromote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is\nthe lifeblood of the university.\nIn this course, class discussions, projects/activities and\nassignments will challenge students to think critically about and be\nsensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity,\nnationality, documentation, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic\nbackground, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and\nother cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged\nto develop or expand their respect and understanding of such\ndifferences.\nMaintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students\nfeel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences,\nideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the\nresponsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or\ndiminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This\nmeans that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or\notherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that\nstudents must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s\ncomments.\n\n\nXII. Using Pronouns and Personal Preference\nThe College of Education is always working to include and engage\neveryone. One way we can do this is to share your pronouns, or the words\nyou want to be called when people aren’t using your name. Like names,\npronouns are an important part of how we identify that deserves to be\nrespected. And we recognize that assuming someone’s gender can be\nhurtful, especially to members of our community who are transgender,\ngenderqueer, or non-binary. As a community, we are all learning together\nabout the importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans\ncommunity on campus. Please discuss the pronouns you wish to be used\nwith your professor to help them be aware of how to address you\nrespectfully. Please visit this university website for more information:\nhttps://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns\n\n\nXIII. Accessible Education\nThe University of Oregon is working to create inclusive learning\nenvironments. Please notify me if there are aspects of the instruction\nor design of this course that result in disability-related barriers to\nyour participation. Participation includes access to lectures, web-based\ninformation, in-class activities, and exams. The Accessible Education\nCenter (http://aec.uoregon.edu/) works with students to provide\nan instructor notification letter that outlines accommodations and\nadjustments to class design that will enable better access.

Accommodation for Religious Observances\nThe university makes reasonable accommodations, upon request, for\nstudents who are unable to attend a class for religious obligations or\nobservance reasons, in accordance with the university discrimination\npolicy which says “Any student who, because of religious beliefs, is\nunable to attend classes on a particular day shall be excused from\nattendance requirements and from any examination or other assignment on\nthat day. The student shall make up the examination or other assignment\nmissed because of the absence.” To request accommodations for this\ncourse for religious observance, visit the Office of the Registrar’s\nwebsite (https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/religious-observances)\nand complete and submit to the instructor the “Student Religious\nAccommodation Request” form prior to the end of the second week of the\nterm.\n\n\nXV. Mental Health and Wellness\nLife at college can be very complicated. Students often feel\noverwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with\nrelationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If\nyou’re facing such challenges, you don’t need to handle them on your\nown–there’s help and support on campus.\nAs your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I\nwill express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to\nresources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the\ndetails of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I\ncare and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to\ndo—for yourself and those you care about.\nUniversity Health Services help students cope with difficult emotions\nand life stressors. If you need general resources on coping with stress\nor want to talk with another student who has been in the same place as\nyou, visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and\nget help from one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. Find\nout more at https://health.uoregon.edu/ducknest.\nUniversity Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff\nmembers to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide\nidentity-based support. All clinical services are free and confidential.\nFind out more at https://counseling.uoregon.edu/ or by calling\n541-346-3227 (anytime UCS is closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis\nLine is available by calling this same number).\n\n\nXVI.
