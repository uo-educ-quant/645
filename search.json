General Guidelines\nThe goal of the assignments is to practice the concepts and\nvocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the\ntechniques we have learned. You may work on your own or collaborate with\none (1) partner. Please make sure that you engage in a a full, fair and\nmutually-agreeable collaboration if you do choose to collaborate. If you\ndo collaborate, you should plan, execute and write-up your analyses\ntogether, not simply divide the work. Please make sure to indicate\nclearly when your work is joint and any other individual or resource\n(outside of class material) you consulted in your responses.\n(Here we need to add more details about global expectations and\nrequirements for all the assignments, grading and points distribution\nfor participation, five assignments, and/or final project/exam, late\nsubmission policy, etc. from syllabus.)\n\n\n2. Submission Requirements\nPlease upload below two files on Canvas before TBD time:\nAn .html or .pdf file that includes both -\nyour typed responses (in your own words and not identical to anybody\nelse’s), tables, and/or figures to the problems\nand the R code chunks that generated your answers (hint: if you\nchoose to compose your answers in markdown, simply set up echo = TRUE,\ninclude = TRUE in you .Rmd file)\n\nThe .Rmd or .R file that you used to render the tables and figures\nin the above html/pdf.\n\n\n3.

Using\na dataset, students/instructors can fit the same regression model\nindependently for each cluster and create a table of intercepts and\nslopes across clusters\nStudents will understand what it means for intercepts and slopes to\nvary across clusters\n\nDevelop/discuss the notion that regression coefficients may vary\nacross different clusters\nDevelop the concept of fixed-effects as the\naggregation of the different intercepts and slopes by taking an average\nof varying intercept and slopes across clusters\nDevelop the concept of random effects as the\ndifference between cluster-specific intercept and slope and their\naverages across clusters\nDevelop the concept of the covariance matrix of\nrandom-effects\nDiscuss the implications of ignoring the variance of\nrandom-effects in terms of the inference for fixed-effects and\nstatistical power\nIntroduce the random intercept-only model, its estimation through\nthe R lmer package, interpret the model parameters and align them with\nthe earlier discussion of fixed-effects and random-effects.\nIntroduce the intra-class correlation as a measure of\nwithin-cluster dependency, and how to use it to decide whether one needs\nto use multilevel modeling\nFinish by emphasizing that this is a very brief introduction of\nnested data and refer students to the multilevel modeling sequence for a\ncomprehensive treatment of the subject\nIf time permits, there may be a discussion that not all nested\ndata needs multilevel modeling and there are alternative approaches to\nadjust the standard errors for fixed effects if they are the sole\ninterest\nReadings:\nLecture:\nLecture slides:\nAssignment 1:\n\n\nUnit 2: Logistic Regression (Week 3-4-5)\nLearning Objectives:\nIntroduce the linear probability model and discuss the\nlimitations\nIntroduce the concept of probability, odds, and logit\nIntroduce the logistic function\nIntroduce the logistic regression model with continuous\npredictors and how to interpret the model parameters and inference for\nmodel parameters\nIntroduce the glm function in R to fit the logistic regression\nmodel\nIntroduce the logistic regression model with categorical\npredictors and how to interpret the model parameters and inference for\nmodel parameters\nIntroduce the logistic regression model with an interaction\nbetween a continuous and categorical predictor, how to interpret the\nmodel parameters, and inference for model parameters\nDiscuss the predictive power, model fit, and diagnostics for a\nlogistic regression model\nReadings:\nLecture:\nLecture slides:\nAssignment 2:\n\n\nUnit 3: Poison Regression (Week 6-7)\nLearning Objectives:\nReadings:\nLecture:\nLecture slides:\nAssignment 3:\n\n\nUnit 4: Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Data (Week 8-9)\nLearning Objectives:\nStudents should be ready to talk about the concept of model-based\nimputation as earlier lectures in the sequence covered linear regression\nand logistic regression\nIntroduce the missing data mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)\nIntroduce the concepts of the listwise deletion and pairwise\ndeletion and their potential limitations\nIntroduce the single-imputation methods (mean, regression, and\nstochastic regression imputation)\nIntroduce the “missing-value-dummy” method (Cohen) and some\nissues with this approach\nIntroduce the conceptual steps for the\nmultiple-imputation\nIntroduce the mice package in R and how to implement\nmultiple-imputation for fitting a regression model to a data set with\nmissing values\nReadings:\nLecture:\nLecture slides:\nAssignment 4:\n\n\nUnit 5: Introduction to Measurement and Assessment (Week 10)\nLearning Objectives:\nIntroduction to the concept of reliability\nTalk about the assumption that there is a single underlying\nconstruct for a set of items in surveys when you aggregate scores across\nitems\nShow how to compute Cronbach’s alpha, how to interpret it, and\nemphasize the strong underlying assumptions\nReadings:\nLecture:\nLecture slides:\nFinal Project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
