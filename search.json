General Guidelines\nThe goal of the assignments is to practice the concepts and\nvocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the\ntechniques we have learned. You may work on your own or collaborate with\none (1) partner. Please make sure that you engage in a a full, fair and\nmutually-agreeable collaboration if you do choose to collaborate. If you\ndo collaborate, you should plan, execute and write-up your analyses\ntogether, not simply divide the work. Please make sure to indicate\nclearly when your work is joint and any other individual or resource\n(outside of class material) you consulted in your responses.\n(Here we need to add more details about global expectations and\nrequirements for all the assignments, grading and points distribution\nfor participation, assignments, and/or final project/exam, late\nsubmission policy, etc. from syllabus.)\n\n\n2. Submission format\nFor each of the four assignments as well as the final project, you\nare required to submit two files:\nAn .doc, .html, or .pdf file that includes your typed responses\n(in your own words and not identical to anybody else’s), tables, and/or\nfigures to the problems\nThe .Rmd or .R file that you used to render the tables and\nfigures in the above doc/html/pdf file.\n\n\n3.

Phasellus mollis\negestas risus, non maximus nisl euismod sit amet. Vestibulum laoreet et\nurna vitae rutrum. Donec quis dui elit.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nYou’ll learn this\nAnd also that\nPerhaps some of this too.\n\n\nRequired Readings\n\n\nCourse Policy\nI will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, don’t\ncheat and try to learn stuff. Don’t be that guy.\n\nGrading Policy\n20% of your grade will be determined by a\nmidterm during normal class hours.\n20% of your grade will be determined by a term\npaper that documents your appreciation of Foghat’s “Slow Ride”, the most\nimportant song ever written. “Slow Ride” is what Mozart wishes Don\nGiovanni could have been.\n10% of your grade will be determined by your\nattendance and participation in class. Generally, ask questions and\nanswer them.\n20% of your grade will be determined by a\n20-page term paper on when exactly “The Love Boat” jumped the proverbial\nshark. You will address whether this shark-jumping can be attributed to\nTed McGinley, the introduction of Jill Whelan as “Vicki”, or some other\ncause.\n30% of your grade will be determined by a final\nexam.\n\n\nAttendance Policy\n\nShowing up is 80 percent of life – Woody Allen, via\nMarshall Brickman Students should be weary of skipping class.\n\n\n\nLate Arrival of the Professor Policy\nMy current university, from what I have been told, asks professors to\nhave policies written into their syllabus about what students should do\nif the professor is more than 15 minutes late to class. This seems like\nan anachronism. I will inform students via e-mail in advance of class if\nclass is cancelled for the day. I will also contact our department\nsecretary if something happened on the way to work. Failing that, assume\nthe worst happened to me. I ask the students make sure that my story\ngets the proper treatment on an Investigation Discovery show. I\nalso ask that my story be narrated by Keith Morrison.\n\n\nE-mail Policy\nI am usually quick to respond to student e-mails. However, student\ne-mails tend to do several things that try my patience. I have a new\npolicy, effective Fall 2016, that outlines why I will not respond to\ncertain e-mails students send. Multiple rationales follow.\nThe student could answer his/her own inquiry by reading the\nsyllabus.\nThe student missed class for which there was no exam. I do not need\nto know the exact reason for a missed class. Students with excusable\nabsences are responsible for giving me a note in hard copy that\ndocuments the reason for the missed class. An e-mail is unnecessary\nunless the impromptu absence involved missing a midterm or final.\nThe student wants to know what topics s/he missed during a class\ns/he skipped. The answer is always “you missed what was on the\nsyllabus.”\nThe student is protesting a grade without reference to specific\npoints of objection. See the policy on protesting a grade in the\nsyllabus. These e-mails tend to be expressive utility on the part of the\nstudent and do not require a response from me. Students interested in\nimproving their knowledge of material should see me during office\nhours.\nThe students wants to know how many classes s/he missed at some\npoint during the semester. I assume the student has a better answer to\nthat question than me until the end of the semester.\nThe student is requesting an extension on an assignment for which\nthe syllabus already established the deadline. The answer is always\n“no”.\nThe student is “grade\ngrubbing” or asking to round up a grade. The answer is always\n“no”.\nThe student is asking for an extra credit opportunity, a request\nthat amounts to more grading for the professor. The answer is “no”.\n\n\nMake-Up Exam Policy\nThere are NO make-ups for missed exams. Don’t bother\nasking.\n\n\nAcademic Dishonesty Policy\nDon’t cheat. Don’t be that guy. Yes, you. You know exactly what I’m\ntalking about too.\n\n\nDisabilities Policy\nFederal law mandates the provision of services at the\nuniversity-level to qualified students with disabilities. Make sure to\ninclude all that relevant information here.\n\n\n\n\nClass Schedule\nStudents must read the following before class session. Important:\nclass readings are subject to change, contingent on mitigating\ncircumstances and the progress we make as a class. Students are\nencouraged to attend lectures and check the course website for\nupdates.\nTaking\nGood Notes\nDos\nand Dont’s of Writing for Students\n\nWeek 01, 03/15 - 03/19: Reviewing GLM and Introduction to Logistic\nRegression\nRequired: * BMLR - Ch. 2 (pp. xx-xx) - 6-6.4 (pp. xx-xx)\nRecommended: * BMLR - - 3.3 ‘Discrete Random Variables’\n(pp. xx-xx)\n\n\nWeek 02, 03/22 - 03/26: Logistic Regression\nRequired: * BMLR - 6.5-6.7 (pp. xx-xx)\nRecommended:\n\n\nWeek 03, 03/29 - 04/02: Logistic Regression\nRequired: * BMLR - (pp. xx-xx)\nRecommended:\n\n\nWeek 04, 04/05 - 04/09: Introduction to Count Data and Poisson\nRegression\nRequired: * BMLR - 4-4.4 (pp. xx-xx)\nRecommended:\n\n\nWeek 05, 04/12 - 04/16: Poisson Regression\nRequired: * BMLR - 4.5-4.10 (pp. xx-xx) - All of Ch. 5\n(pp. xx-xx)\nRecommended:\n\n\nWeek 06, 04/19 - 04/23: Nested Data\nRequired: * BMLR - 8-8.5 (pp. xx-xx)\nRecommended:\n\n\nWeek 07, 04/26 - 04/30: Nested Data\nRequired: * BMLR - 8.6-8.11 (pp. xx-xx)\nRecommended:\n\n\nWeek 08, 05/03 - 05/07: Nested Data\nRequired: * BMLR - 9-9.7 (pp. xx-xx) - Ch 11\nRecommended:\n\n\nWeek 09, 05/10 - 05/14: Measurement Error and Reliability\nRequired: * BMLR - 7-7.8 (pp. xx-xx)\nRecommended:\n\n\nWeek 10, 05/17 - 05/21: Missing Data\nRequired: *\n- XX (pp. xx-xx)\nRecommended:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is strongly\nrecommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, available here.\nBoth softwares are free. We will provide tutorials on R/RStudio\ninstallation and they are also accessible here.\n\nResources for R and RStudio\nWhile we will teach you how to effectively use R and RStudio to\nconduct analyses, one of the key skills required to use R is the ability\nto find answers on your own. Many common questions or problems are\neither available on blogs or have been asked and answered in discussion\nforums already. Finding and deciphering those answers is an important\nskill you should seek to hone. You will never remember all of the\nprogramming commands!\nHere are some sites where you can find the answers to many R\nquestions and learn new tricks:\nYaRrr, the\nPirate’s Guide to R by Nathaniel Phillips\nR for Data Science by\nHadley Wickham\nR Cookbook by\nWinston Chang\nAn Introduction to\nStatistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor\nHastie and Robert Tibshirani\nCheat\nSheets\nQuick-R\nStackOverflow\nStack Exchange\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\nFor more details, see here.\nUnits\nUniti Topics\nWeeks\nLecture Topics\nLab Objectives\nRequired Readings\nRecommended Readings\nAssignments\nQuizzes\n1\nLogistic Regression\n1\na.

While some may\nfeel that this is overly paternalistic, research evidence shows that\nfrequent quizzing increases learning (see a summary of one\nstudy from the University of Texas). Quizzes will be open book and\nnotes (but not laptop/computer).\n\n\nAssignments\nThe goal of the assignments is to practice the concepts and\nvocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the\ntechniques we have learned. Each assignment has an associated data\nsource, short codebook and detailed instructions for the required data\nand analytic tasks. You may work on your own or collaborate with one (1)\npartner. Please make sure that you engage in a a full, fair and\nmutually-agreeable collaboration if you do choose to collaborate. If you\ndo collaborate, you should plan, execute and write-up your analyses\ntogether, not simply divide the work. Please make sure to indicate\nclearly when your work is joint and any other individual or resource\n(outside of class material) you consulted in your response. Further\nassignment details are available here.\n\n\nFinal\n\n\n\nStudent Engagement Inventory\nGraduate students are expected to perform work of high quality and\nquantity, typically with forty hours of student engagement for each\nstudent credit hour. For this course, the following table shows the\nnumber of hours a typical student would expect to spend in each of the\nfollowing activities:\nEducational activity\nHours\nExplanatory comments\nClass attendance\n30\nThree hours per week over 10 weeks\nClass reading and prep\n30\nIncludes reading and review of slides\nHomework Assignments\n20\nFive assignments taking 5 hours each (on avg.)\nQuizzes\n5\nOne hour per quiz (40 min preparation, 20 min completing quiz)\nLab attendance\n10\nOne hour-long lab per week over 10 weeks\nFinal project\n25\nIncludes familiarization with data, data analysis, preparation of\ndisplays and writing\nTotal hours\n120\nThese are approximations.
