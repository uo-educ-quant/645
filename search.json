Full requirements for assignments,\ninformation on grading, and the late submission policy are discussed in\nthe syllabus.\nYou may work on your own or with up to two (2) partners. If you\nchoose to work with others, please make sure that you engage in a full,\nfair, and mutually-agreeable collaboration. Plan, execute, and write-up\nyour analyses together; do not simply divide up the work.\nEvery person should submit the 2 files described\nbelow. If you worked collaboratively, each person can submit\nthe same documents, but each person’s submission should include 1) their\nown name, 2) an indication that the work is joint and the names of your\nother collaborators, and 3) information on any other individual or\nresource (outside of class material) you consulted in your\nresponses.\n\n\nSubmission format\nFor each of the 3 assignments and the final project, you are required\nto submit the following files:\n.doc, .html, or .pdf file with your typed responses to the\nproblems and any tables and figures you produce.\n.Rmd or .R file you used to render tables and figures.

These methods are similar to those used for dichotomous outcomes (remember that another way of thinking of counts is that they measure a series of dichotomous outcomes).\nNormally distributed data\nWe previously looked at a more normally distributed variable from NHANES: SleepHrsNight, the self-reported number of hours of sleep a participant usually gets.\n–\nNHANES_data1112 %>% \n  ggplot(aes(SleepHrsNight)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)\n\nCount data\nDaysMHBad_count, the number of days per month an NHANES participant reports experiencing poor mental health.\n–\nNHANES_data1112 %>% \n  ggplot(aes(DaysMHBad_count)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)\n\nclass: middle, inverse\nAnalyzing count data\nOptions for analysing count data\n–\n Linear regression: Count outcome variables are sometimes log-transformed and analyzed using OLS regression.\n–\nMany issues in addition to violating model assumptions, including biased estimates and loss of data because it is necessary to take the log of zero (which is undefined).\n–\n Poisson regression: Often used for modeling count data.\n–\n Negative binomial regression: Similar to Poisson regression, but relaxes the restrictive assumption of the Poisson model that the mean of the count outcome equals the variance of the outcome.\n–\n Zero-inflated regression model: Used to account for excess zeros produced by a different process from “true” zeros.\nAssessing variability\nWe can get a preliminary sense of whether overdispersion is present by comparing the mean and variance of the DaysMHBad_count variable we looked at earlier. Here we’ll limit the data to participants 16 or older because the independent variable we’ll look at shortly was not measured in participants under 16.\n–\nNHANES_data1112 %>% \n  filter(Age >= 16) %>% \n  summarize(mean = mean(DaysMHBad_count),\n            variance = var(DaysMHBad_count))\n\n               ┌──────────────────┐\n               │  mean   variance │\n               ├──────────────────┤\n               │  3.88       59.5 │\n               └──────────────────┘\n\nColumn names: mean, variance\n–\nThe variance of the counts far exceeds the mean, suggesting overdispersion. We’ll formally assess overdispersion of model residuals once we’ve fitted our models.\n–\nThis said, these values are a good indication that we should go with negative binomial regression, but we’ll compare it against a Poisson regression model to confirm.\nFitting a model\nHere, we’ll look at whether there is a relationship between participants’ self-reported sleep quality (Sleep_Trouble) and the number of days per month they have poor mental health (DaysMHBad_count). To fit a negative binomial model we’ll use the glm.nb function from the MASS package (included with R).\n–\nlibrary(MASS)\nmod_1 <- glm.nb(DaysMHBad_count ~ Sleep_Trouble, \n                data = NHANES_data1112)\n\n–\nFitting a comparable Poisson model for a comparison of fit.\nmod_1b <- glm(DaysMHBad_count ~ Sleep_Trouble, family = poisson(),\n              data = NHANES_data1112)\n\nFitting a model\n–\n.pull-left[\nDeviance:\nmod_1b$deviance # Poisson\n\n#> [1] 33116.23\n\nmod_1$deviance # Neg Binom\n\n#> [1] 2652.866\n\n]\n–\n.pull-right[\nAIC:\nmod_1b$aic # Poisson\n\n#> [1] 38025.25\n\nmod_1$aic # Neg Binom\n\n#> [1] 13187.78\n\n]\n–\nAnd most critically, we can see that the Poisson gave us much smaller standard errors, which would produce artificially narrow confidence intervals.\nsummary(mod_1b)$coefficients[2, \"Std. Error\"] # Poisson\n\n#> [1] 0.01774997\n\nsummary(mod_1)$coefficients[2, \"Std. Error\"] # Neg Binom\n\n#> [1] 0.09383608\n\nFitting a model\nWe can also look at whether the negative binomial model better accounts for overdispersion. We’ll use the DHARMa package again.\n–\nmod_1_residuals <- simulateResiduals(mod_1)\ntestDispersion(mod_1_residuals, \n               alternative = \"greater\", plot = F)\n\n#> \n#> \tDHARMa nonparametric dispersion test via sd of\n#> \tresiduals fitted vs. simulated\n#> \n#> data:  simulationOutput\n#> dispersion = 0.58444, p-value = 1\n#> alternative hypothesis: greater\n\n–\nCompared with the Poisson:\n–\n.pull-left[\nmod_1b_residuals_p$statistic\n\n#> dispersion \n#>   14.74392\n\n]\n–\n.pull-right[\nmod_1b_residuals_p$p.value\n\n#> [1] 0\n\n]\nBasic interpretaton\nLike logistic regression, we have to exponentiate the model coefficients to interpret the results. With counts, the exponentiated coefficient is a rate ratio.\n–\nmod_1 %>% \n  broom::tidy(exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE)\n\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n│ term       estimate   std.erro   statisti    p.value\n│                              r          c\n├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n│ (Interce        3       0.0492      22.3    3.28e-11\n│ pt)                                                0\n│ Sleep_Tr        2.1     0.0938       7.91   2.64e-15\n│ oubleYes                                            \n└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nColumn names: term, estimate, std.error, statistic,\np.value, conf.low, conf.high\n5/7 columns shown.\n–\nCompared with participants who do not have trouble sleeping, participants who have trouble sleeping on average experience 2.13 times as many days per month with poor mental health (95% CI [1.78, 2.57]).\n–\nOn average, participants who have trouble sleeping experience 113% more poor mental health days each month (95% CI [1.78, 2.57]) than participants who do not have trouble sleeping.\ndrvisits data\nLet’s look at data from a study that uses a common design in the social sciences: a single-group pre-post study, where one group is exposed to an intervention and the difference in the outcome measure before and after the intervention is compared.\n–\nThe drvisits dataset includes the following variables:\n\nNumber of visits\ndrvisits %>% \n  ggplot(aes(visits)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)\n\nInitial model\nFirst we’ll fit our initial model, which will be a Poisson model and include the number of visits as the outcome and time point of the intervention (before/after) as the IV. We’ll include a random intercept for patients, because the data the observations are clustered within patients.\ndrvisits_m1 <- glmer(visits ~ intervention + (1 | id),\n                     family = poisson(), data = drvisits)\n\nExamine overdispersion\nNext, we’ll look at the results of the dispersion test from DHARMa to decide if we should use a negative-binomial model instead of Poisson.\ndrvisits_m1_residuals <- simulateResiduals(drvisits_m1 , n = 1000) \ntestDispersion(drvisits_m1_residuals, alternative = \"greater\", plot = F)\n\n#> \n#> \tDHARMa nonparametric dispersion test via sd of\n#> \tresiduals fitted vs. simulated\n#> \n#> data:  simulationOutput\n#> dispersion = 1.1013, p-value = 0.232\n#> alternative hypothesis: greater\n\n–\nThis suggests we don’t have concerning overdispersion in the model residuals, so we’ll stick to the more parsimonious Poisson.\nAdding covariates\nIn many research areas, there can often be a relatively standard set of sociodemographic characteristics that are  controlled for.

The course is organized around the principle that research\ndesign and analysis depends on researchers’ substantive questions and\nthe data they have available to address these questions. In this\nintermediate level course, students will learn about and practice using\nanalytic models and strategies that are suitable for examining data that\nhave (a) a dichotomous outcome variable, (b) a count outcome variable,\n(c) a nested structure, and/or (d) missing values. Students will also\nlearn (e) when and how to estimate internal consistency reliability. The\ncourse seeks to blend a conceptual, mathematical, and applied\nunderstanding of introductory statistical concepts. Students will employ\nthese statistical tools in a variety of applications, with a particular\nemphasis on strategies to generate research products relevant to\nculturally and linguistically diverse communities. At the core of our\npedagogical approach is the belief that students learn statistical\nanalysis by doing statistical analysis.\nEDUC 643 (or a similar intermediate statistics course) is a\npre-requisite as is a basic familiarity with a statistical programming\nlanguage (preferably R).\n\n\nMeeting Time and Location\nTuesdays and Thursdays, 5:00pm–6:20pm (HEDCO 142)\nLab: Mondays, 1:00-1:50pm and Tuesdays, 6:30-7:20pm (ED 115)\n\n\nInstructor\nNicholas J.

General Course Information\nEDUC 645 (EDUC 610L): Applied Statistics in Education and\nHuman Services III (3 credits) - Spring 2025 (31742)\nMeeting Time and Location\nTuesdays and Thursdays, 5:00pm–6:20pm (HEDCO 142)\nLab: Mondays, 1:00-1:50pm and Tuesdays, 6:30-7:20pm (ED 115)\nInstructor:\nNicholas J. Parr, PhD, MPH (he/him/his); Email: nparr2@uoregon.edu\n(preferred); Office hour: by appointment\nGTFs:\nHavisha (Havi) Khurana (she/her/hers); Email: havishak@uoregon.edu (preferred); Office hours:\nTBD\nBrittany Spinner (she/her/hers); Email: bspinner@uoregon.edu (preferred); Office hour: by\nappointment\n\n\nII. Course Overview\nThis course is the third in a sequence intended to provide a toolkit\nof statistical concepts, methods, and their implementation to producers\nof applied research in education, human services, and other social\nsciences. The course is organized around the principle that research\ndesign and analysis depends on researchers’ substantive questions and\nthe data they have available to address these questions. In this\nintermediate level course, students will learn about and practice using\nanalytic models and strategies that are suitable for examining data that\nhave (a) a dichotomous outcome variable, (b) a count outcome variable,\n(c) a nested structure, and/or (d) missing values. Students will also\nlearn (e) when and how to estimate internal consistency reliability. The\ncourse seeks to blend a conceptual, mathematical, and applied\nunderstanding of introductory statistical concepts. Students will employ\nthese statistical tools in a variety of applications, with a particular\nemphasis on strategies to generate research products relevant to\nculturally and linguistically diverse communities. At the core of our\npedagogical approach is the belief that students learn statistical\nanalysis by doing statistical analysis.\nEDUC 643 (or a similar intermediate statistics course) is a\npre-requisite as is a basic familiarity with a statistical programming\nlanguage (preferably R).\n\n\nIII. Student Learning Outcomes\nBy the end of this term, it is expected that students will be able\nto:\nDetermine when it is appropriate to use logistic regression or\nPoisson regression analyses and analyses that account for nested data in\neducation and human services research.\nConduct and interpret basic logistic and Poisson regression\nanalyses and analyses that account for nested data.\nDescribe the assumptions of logistic and Poisson regression\nanalyses and analyses for nested data, and test analytic models for the\nextent to which they satisfy the models’ assumptions.\nUnderstand the role of reliability in linear models and calculate\ninternal consistency coefficients.\nExplain common mechanisms of missingness and the applications and\nlimitations of different methods for handling missing data.\nAssess missing data characteristics and implement multiple\nimputation to handle missing data.\nUse the above applied statistical tools (alongside others learned\nin prior courses in the EDUC quantitative sequence) to generate research\nthat is relevant to culturally and linguistically diverse\ncommunities.\nPerform all analyses using an object-oriented, open-source\nprogramming language.\n\n\nTextbooks, Reading Materials, and Software\n\nTextbooks\nThe following text and reading materials are required:\nRoback, P., & Legler, J. (2021). Beyond multiple linear\nregression: Applied generalized linear models and multilevel models in R\n(1st ed.). CRC Press. https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/\nDunn, T. J., Baguley, T., & Brunsden V. (2014). From alpha to\nomega: A practical solution to the pervasive problem of internal\nconsistency estimation. British Journal of Psychology, 105, 399–412. https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12046\nLittle, T. D., Jorgensen, T. D., Lang, K. M., & Moore, W. G.\n(2014). On the joys of missing data. Journal of Pediatric Psychology,\n39(2), 151–162. https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jst048\nWe will primarily be referring to chapters in Roback and Legler’s Beyond Multiple\nLinear Regression (BMLR), which is available for\nfree online.\n\n\nSupplemental reading materials\nFurther readings will be provided in the form of peer-reviewed\njournal articles. Links to these papers will be provided in the\nschedule.\n\n\nR and RStudio\nStudents must have the latest version of R, which can be downloaded\nhere. It is strongly\nrecommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, available here.\nBoth are free.\n\nResources for R and RStudio\nWhile this course teaches you how to effectively use R and RStudio to\nconduct analyses, one of the key skills required to use R is the ability\nto find answers on your own. Many common questions or problems are\neither available on blogs or have been asked and answered in discussion\nforums already. Finding and deciphering those answers is an important\nskill you should seek to hone. It is impossible to remember all\nprogramming commands!\nHere are some sites where you can find the answers to many R\nquestions and learn new tricks:\nYaRrr, the\nPirate’s Guide to R by Nathaniel Phillips\nR for Data Science by\nHadley Wickham\nR Cookbook by\nWinston Chang\nAn Introduction to\nStatistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor\nHastie and Robert Tibshirani\nCheat\nSheets\nQuick-R\nStackOverflow\nStack Exchange\n\n\n\n\nIV. Weekly Schedule of Topics, Assignments, and Readings\nSee here.\n\n\nV. Grading Components and Criteria\nGrades will be assigned in accordance with the College of Education\ngrading requirements. Grades are criterion-referenced; that is, each\nstudent’s performance is graded according to the extent to which they\nmeet the course learning and performance criteria and exhibit individual\nlearning. You can check your assignment grades and points on Canvas.\nThe due dates for course assignments and the final are posted here. Late work can receive a grade no\nhigher than a B+ unless an extension has been requested and approved by\nthe instructor before the assignment is due.\nAssignments submitted after the last day of class will be given no\ncredit.\nFinal grades will be based on the following components:\nQuizzes: 15% (3 quizzes at 5% each)\nAssignments: 45% (3 assignments at 15% each)\nFinal Project: 25%\nParticipation/Attendance: 15%\nGrade\nPercentage\nGrade\nPercentage\nA+\n>= 98%\nC+\n77% to < 80%\nA\n94% to < 98%\nC\n73% to < 77%\nA-\n90% to < 94%\nC-\n70% to < 73%\nB+\n87% to < 90%\nD\n60% to < 70%\nB\n83% to < 87%\nF\n< 60%\nB-\n80% to < 83%\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nEach of the three units will include an open-book/open-note quiz\ntaken on Canvas. Quizzes will cover core concepts discussed in the\ninitial lectures of each unit.\n\n\nAssignments\nThe goal of the assignments is to practice the concepts and\nvocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the\ntechniques we have discussed. Each assignment has an associated data\nsource, short codebook, and detailed instructions for the required data\nand analytic tasks. You may work on your own or collaborate with up to\ntwo (2) partners. Please make sure that you engage in a full, fair, and\nmutually-agreeable collaboration if you do choose to collaborate. If you\ndo collaborate, you should plan, execute, and write-up your analyses\ntogether; do not simply divide up the work. Please make sure to indicate\nclearly when your work is joint and any other individual or resource\n(outside of class material) you consulted in your responses. Further\nassignment details are available on the course website. Further\nassignment details are available here.\nAssignments will be evaluated based on students’ performance in\ncompleting the assignment tasks, showing their work, and in\ndemonstrating their understanding of the course concepts and\nterminology.\n\n\nFinal\nThe final assignment involves a more extended application of methods\ncovered in this course. Instructions for the final assignment will be\nprovided during Week 9 and listed here.\n\n\nParticipation/Attendance\nGraduate students are expected to regularly attend and participate in\nclass meetings (see Attendance and Absence Guidelines, below). Unexcused\nabsences (absences for which the instructor has not been notified ahead\nof time) adversely impact participation. Students with one (1) unexcused\nabsence will be penalized 5% from their final course grade. Students\nwith two (2) or more unexcused absences will be penalized the full 15%\nof the Participation/Attendance component of their final\ngrade.\n\n\n\nVI. Statement of How Requirements Differ for Undergraduate and\nGraduate Students\nThis course does not have an undergraduate section.\n\n\nVII. Role of Graduate Employees\nIf you are concurrently taking any courses with the graduate employee\n(GE) assigned to this course, please let the instructor know. The GE\nwill not be involved with any review of assignments for students in this\ncourse who are taking other courses concurrently.\n\n\nVIII. Student Engagement Inventory\nGraduate students are expected to perform work of high quality and\nquantity, typically with forty hours of student engagement for each\nstudent credit hour. For this course, the following table shows the\nnumber of hours a typical student would expect to spend in each of the\nfollowing activities:\nEducational activity\nHours\nExplanatory comments\nClass attendance\n30\nThree hours per week over 10 weeks\nClass reading and prep\n30\nIncludes reading and review of slides\nAssignments\n24\nThree assignments taking 8 hours each (on avg.)\nQuizzes\n5\n1 hour per quiz (40 min preparation, 20 min completing quiz)\nLab attendance\n10\nOne hour-long lab per week over 10 weeks\nFinal project\n21\nIncludes familiarization with data, data analysis, preparation of\ngraphics and writing\nTotal hours\n120\n\n\n\nIX. Attendance and Absence Guidelines\nAttendance is required. In-person attendance at our scheduled class\nmeetings is expected and is integral to success in the course. In the\ncase of unavoidable absence, students must inform the instructor as\nearly as possible to discuss make-up work. If you need accommodation\nrelated to disability, you can request those by working with the\nAccessible Education Center (https://aec.uoregon.edu).\n\n\nX. Expected Classroom Behavior\nMinimally, we follow the Golden Rule of treating others as we wish to\nbe treated. We must also attend to equity concerns and understand that\neach of us has a unique experience and we vary in our values and\nexpectations.\n\n\nXI. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nIt is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value\nequity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for\nall students. To do so requires that we:\nrespect the dignity and essential worth of all\nindividuals.\npromote a culture of respect throughout the University\ncommunity.\nrespect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.\nreject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any\nkind.\npractice personal and academic integrity and expect it from\nothers.\npromote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is\nthe lifeblood of the university.\nIn this course, class discussions, projects/activities and\nassignments will challenge students to think critically about and be\nsensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity,\nnationality, documentation, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic\nbackground, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and\nother cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged\nto develop or expand their respect and understanding of such\ndifferences.\nMaintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students\nfeel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences,\nideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the\nresponsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or\ndiminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This\nmeans that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or\notherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that\nstudents must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s\ncomments.\n\n\nXII. Using Pronouns and Personal Preference\nThe College of Education is always working to include and engage\neveryone. One way we can do this is to share your pronouns, or the words\nyou want to be called when people aren’t using your name. Like names,\npronouns are an important part of how we identify that deserves to be\nrespected. And we recognize that assuming someone’s gender can be\nhurtful, especially to members of our community who are transgender,\ngenderqueer, or non-binary. As a community, we are all learning together\nabout the importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans\ncommunity on campus. Please discuss the pronouns you wish to be used\nwith your professor to help them be aware of how to address you\nrespectfully. Please visit this university website for more information:\nhttps://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns\n\n\nXIII. Accessible Education\nThe University of Oregon is working to create inclusive learning\nenvironments. Please notify me if there are aspects of the instruction\nor design of this course that result in disability-related barriers to\nyour participation. Participation includes access to lectures, web-based\ninformation, in-class activities, and exams. The Accessible Education\nCenter (http://aec.uoregon.edu/) works with students to provide\nan instructor notification letter that outlines accommodations and\nadjustments to class design that will enable better access. Contact the\nAccessible Education Center in 360 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or uoaec@uoregon.edu for\nassistance with access or disability-related questions or concerns.\n\n\nXIV. Accommodation for Religious Observances\nThe university makes reasonable accommodations, upon request, for\nstudents who are unable to attend a class for religious obligations or\nobservance reasons, in accordance with the university discrimination\npolicy which says “Any student who, because of religious beliefs, is\nunable to attend classes on a particular day shall be excused from\nattendance requirements and from any examination or other assignment on\nthat day. The student shall make up the examination or other assignment\nmissed because of the absence.” To request accommodations for this\ncourse for religious observance, visit the Office of the Registrar’s\nwebsite (https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/religious-observances)\nand complete and submit to the instructor the “Student Religious\nAccommodation Request” form prior to the end of the second week of the\nterm.\n\n\nXV. Mental Health and Wellness\nLife at college can be very complicated. Students often feel\noverwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with\nrelationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If\nyou’re facing such challenges, you don’t need to handle them on your\nown–there’s help and support on campus.\nAs your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I\nwill express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to\nresources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the\ndetails of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I\ncare and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to\ndo—for yourself and those you care about.\nUniversity Health Services help students cope with difficult emotions\nand life stressors. If you need general resources on coping with stress\nor want to talk with another student who has been in the same place as\nyou, visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and\nget help from one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. Find\nout more at https://health.uoregon.edu/ducknest.\nUniversity Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff\nmembers to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide\nidentity-based support. All clinical services are free and confidential.\nFind out more at https://counseling.uoregon.edu/ or by calling\n541-346-3227 (anytime UCS is closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis\nLine is available by calling this same number).\n\n\nXVI. Basic Needs\nAny student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing\nsufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place\nto live and believes this may affect their performance in the course is\nurged to contact the Dean of Students Office (346-3216, 164 Oregon Hall)\nfor support.\nThis UO webpage includes resources for food, housing, healthcare,\nchildcare, transportation, technology, finances, and legal support: https://blogs.uoregon.edu/basicneeds/food/ If your need\nis urgent, please contact the Care and Advocacy Program by calling\n541-346-3216, filling out the Community\nCare and Support form, or by scheduling\nan appointment with an advocate.\n\n\nXVII. Respect for Diversity\nYou can expect to be treated with respect in this course. Both\nstudents and your instructor(s) enter with many identities, backgrounds,\nand beliefs. Students of all racial identities, ethnicities, and\ngenders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins,\nreligious affiliations, sexual orientation, citizenship statuses,\nability and other visible and non-visible differences belong in and\ncontribute to this class and this discipline. All students are expected\nto contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for\nevery member of the class.\nClass rosters are provided to instructors with students’ legal names.\nPlease let me know if the name or pronouns I have for you are not\naccurate. It is important to me to address you properly.\nPlease let me know if aspects of the instruction, course design, or\nclass activities undermine these principles in any way. You may also\nnotify the (Home Department) at (contact information). For additional\nassistance and resources, you may also consider contacting the Division of Equity and Inclusion\nthrough their website or by phone (at 541-346-3175), or the Center\nfor Multicultural Academic Excellence through their website or by\nphone (at 541-346-3479).\n\n\nXVII. Academic Integrity\nThe University Student Conduct Code (available at\nconduct.uoregon.edu) defines academic misconduct. Students are\nprohibited from committing or attempting to commit any act that\nconstitutes academic misconduct. By way of example, students should not\ngive or receive (or attempt to give or receive) unauthorized help on\nassignments or examinations without express permission from the\ninstructor. Students should properly acknowledge and document all\nsources of information (e.g., quotations, paraphrases, ideas) and use\nonly the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is\nany question about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is\nthe students’ obligation to clarify the question with the instructor\nbefore committing or attempting to commit the act. Additional\ninformation about a common form of academic misconduct, plagiarism, is\navailable at https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism.\n\n\nXIX. Mandatory Reporter Status\nI am an assisting employee. For information about my reporting\nobligations as an employee, please see Employee\nReporting Obligations on the Office of Investigations and Civil\nRights Compliance (OICRC) website. Students experiencing any form of\nprohibited discrimination or harassment, including sex or gender-based\nviolence, may seek information and resources at safe.uoregon.edu,\nrespect.uoregon.edu, or investigations.uoregon.edu or contact the\nnon-confidential Title IX office/Office of Civil Rights Compliance\n(541-346-3123), or Dean of Students offices (541-346-3216), or call the\n24-7 hotline 541-346-SAFE for help. I am also a mandatory reporter of\nchild abuse. Please find more information at Mandatory\nReporting of Child Abuse and Neglect.\n\n\nXX. Academic Disruption due to Campus Emergency\nIn the event of a campus emergency that disrupts academic activities,\ncourse requirements, deadlines, and grading percentages are subject to\nchange. Information about changes in this course will be communicated as\nsoon as possible by email, and on Canvas. If we are not able to meet\nface-to-face, students should immediately log onto Canvas and read any\nannouncements and/or access alternative assignments. Students are also\nencouraged to continue the readings and other assignments as outlined in\nthis syllabus or subsequent syllabi.\n\n\nXXI. Inclement Weather\nIt is generally expected that class will meet unless the University\nis officially closed for inclement weather. If it becomes necessary to\ncancel class while the University remains open, this will be announced\non Canvas and by email. Updates on inclement weather and closure are\nalso communicated in other ways described here: https://hr.uoregon.edu/about-hr/campus-notifications/inclement-weather/inclement-weather-immediate-updates\n\n\nXXII. Conflict Resolution\nSeveral options, both informal and formal, are available to resolve\nconflicts for students who believe they have been subjected to or have\nwitnessed bias, unfairness, or other improper treatment.\nIt is important to exhaust the administrative remedies available to\nyou including discussing the conflict with the specific individual,\ncontacting the Department Head, or within the College of Education, fall\nterm you can contact the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Sylvia\nThompson, (541) 346-2483, sthomps5@uoregon.edu. Outside the College, you can\ncontact:\nUO Bias Response Team: 346-3216 http://bias.uoregon.edu/whatbrt.htm\nConflict Resolution Services 346-3216 http://studentlife.uoregon.edu/support\nAffirmative Action and Equal Opportunity: 346-3123 http://aaeo.uoregon.edu/\n\n\nXXIII. Grievance Policy\nA student or group of students of the College of Education may appeal\ndecisions or actions pertaining to admissions, programs, evaluation of\nperformance and program retention and completion. Students who decide to\nfile a grievance should follow University student grievance procedures\n(https://policies.uoregon.edu/grievance-procedures)\nand/or consult with the College Associate Dean for Academic Affairs\n(Sylvia Thompson, (541) 346-2483 sthomps5@uoregon.edu).\n\n\nXXIV. Course Incomplete Policy\nStudents are expected to be familiar with university policy regarding\ngrades of “incomplete” and the timeline for completion. For details on\nthe policy and procedures regarding incompletes, Please see: https://education.uoregon.edu/academics/incompletes-courses\n\n\nXXV. Reporting Title IX Experiences\nAny student who has experienced sexual assault, relationship\nviolence, sex or gender-based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual\nharassment may seek resources and help at safe.uoregon.edu. To get help\nby phone, a student can also call either the UO’s 24-hour hotline at\n541-346-7244 [SAFE], or the non-confidential Title IX Coordinator at\n541-346-8136. From the SAFE website, students may also connect to\nCallisto, a confidential, third-party reporting site that is not a part\nof the university.\nStudents experiencing any other form of prohibited discrimination or\nharassment can find information at https://respect.uoregon.edu/ or https://aaeo.uoregon.edu/ or contact the\nnon-confidential AAEO office at 541-346-3123 or the Dean of Students\nOffice at 541-346-3216 for help. As UO policy has different reporting\nrequirements based on the nature of the reported harassment or\ndiscrimination, additional information about reporting requirements for\ndiscrimination or harassment unrelated to sexual assault, relationship\nviolence, sex or gender based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual\nharassment is available at http://aaeo.uoregon.edu/content/discrimination-harassment\nSpecific details about confidentiality of information and reporting\nobligations of employees can be found at https://titleix.uoregon.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
