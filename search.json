Course Overview\nThis course is the third in a sequence intended to provide a toolkit\nof statistical concepts, methods, and their implementation to producers\nof applied research in education, human services, and other social\nsciences. The course is organized around the principle that research\ndesign depends in part on researchers’ substantive questions and their\nquantitative data available to address these questions. In this\nupper-level introductory course, students will learn about and practice\nusing analytic models and strategies that are suitable for examining\ndata that have (a) a dichotomous outcome variable, (b) a count outcome\nvariable, (c) a nested structure, and/or (d) missing values; students\nwill also learn about when and how to estimate (e) internal consistency\nand interrater reliability for research purposes. The course seeks to\nblend a conceptual, mathematical, and applied understanding of\nintroductory statistical concepts. At the core of our pedagogical\napproach is the belief that students learn statistical analysis by doing\nstatistical analysis.\nEDUC 643 (or a similar intermediate statistics course) is a\npre-requisite as is a basic familiarity with a statistical programming\nlanguage (preferably R).\n\n\nIII. Student Learning Outcomes\nBy the end of this term, it is expected that students will be able\nto:\nDetermine when it is appropriate to use logistic regression or\nPoisson regression analyses and analyses that account for nested data in\neducation and human services research.\nConduct and interpret basic logistic and Poisson regression\nanalyses and analyses for nested data.\nDescribe the assumptions of logistic and Poisson regression\nanalyses and analyses for nested data, and test analytic models for the\nextent to which they satisfy the models’ assumptions.\nExplain and apply the concepts of reliability and agreement in\nmeasurement for research purposes.\nExplain common mechanisms of missingness and the applications and\nlimitations of different methods for handling missing data.\nAssess missing data characteristics and implement multiple\nimputation to handle missing data.\nPerform all analyses using an object-oriented, open-source\nprogramming language.\n\n\nIV. Textbooks and Reading Materials\n\nTextbooks\nThe following text and reading materials are required:\nRoback, P., & Legler, J. (2021). Beyond multiple linear\nregression: Applied generalized linear models and multilevel models in R\n(1st ed.). CRC Press. https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/\nDunn, T. J., Baguley, T., & Brunsden V. (2014). From alpha to\nomega: A practical solution to the pervasive problem of internal\nconsistency estimation. British Journal of Psychology, 105, 399–412. https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12046\nHallgren, K. A. (2012). Computing inter-rater reliability for\nobservational data: An overview and tutorial. Tutorials in Quantitative\nMethods for Psychology, 8(1), 23–34. https://doi.org/10.20982/tqmp.08.1.p023\nLittle, T. D., Jorgensen, T. D., Lang, K. M., & Moore, W. G.\n(2013). On the joys of missing data. Journal of Pediatric Psychology,\n39(2), 151–162. https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jst048\nWe will primarily be referring to chapters in Roback and Legler’s Beyond Multiple\nLinear Regression (BMLR), which is available for\nfree online.\n\n\nR and RStudio\nStudents must have the latest version of R, which can be downloaded\nhere. It is strongly\nrecommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, available here.\nBoth softwares are free. We will provide tutorials on R/RStudio\ninstallation and they are also accessible here.\n\nResources for R and RStudio\nWhile we will teach you how to effectively use R and RStudio to\nconduct analyses, one of the key skills required to use R is the ability\nto find answers on your own. Many common questions or problems are\neither available on blogs or have been asked and answered in discussion\nforums already. Finding and deciphering those answers is an important\nskill you should seek to hone. You will never remember all of the\nprogramming commands!\nHere are some sites where you can find the answers to many R\nquestions and learn new tricks:\nYaRrr, the\nPirate’s Guide to R by Nathaniel Phillips\nR for Data Science by\nHadley Wickham\nR Cookbook by\nWinston Chang\nAn Introduction to\nStatistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor\nHastie and Robert Tibshirani\nCheat\nSheets\nQuick-R\nStackOverflow\nStack Exchange\n\n\n\n\nIV. Weekly Schedule of Topics, Assignments, and Readings\nSee here.\n\n\nV. Grading Components and Criteria\nGrades will be assigned in accordance with the College of Education\ngrading requirements. Grades are criterion-referenced; that is, each\nstudent’s performance is graded according to the extent to which they\nmeet the course learning and performance criteria and exhibit individual\nlearning. You can check your assignment grades and points on Canvas.\nThe due dates for course assignments and the final are posted here. A maximum of 75% credit will be\nearned for work submitted up to 3 days late; assignments more than 3\ndays late will be given no credit.\nFinal grades will be based on the following components:\nQuizzes: 20% (5 quizzes 4% each)\nAssignments: 60% (3 assignments, 20% each)\nFinal Project: 20%\nGrade\nPercentage\nGrade\nPercentage\nA+\n>_ 98%\nC+\n77% to < 80%\nA\n94% to < 98%\nC\n73% to < 77%\nA-\n80% to < 94%\nC-\n70% to < 73%\nB+\n87% to < 90%\nD\n60% to < 70%\nB\n83% to < 87%\nF\n< 60%\nB-\n80% to < 83%\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nFive classes will begin with a very short multiple-choice quiz that\nis designed to test your knowledge of the theoretical principles\nunderlying the statistics we are studying for the week. Quizzes will be\nopen book and notes.\n\n\nAssignments\nThe goal of the assignments is to practice the concepts and\nvocabulary we have been modeling in class and implement some of the\ntechniques we have learned. Each assignment has an associated data\nsource, short codebook and detailed instructions for the required data\nand analytic tasks. You may work on your own or with up to two (2)\npartners. If you choose to work with others, please make sure that you\nengage in a full, fair, and mutually-agreeable collaboration. Plan,\nexecute, and write-up your analyses together; do not simply divide up\nthe work. Further assignment details are available here. Assignments will be evaluated based\non students’ performance in completing the assignment tasks, showing\ntheir work, and in demonstrating their understanding of the course\nconcepts and terminology.\n\n\nFinal\nThe final assignment involves a more extended application and\nsynthesis of the concepts of descriptive and relational applied data\nanalysis covered in this course.\n\n\n\nVI. Statement of How Requirements Differ for Undergraduate and\nGraduate Students\nThis course does not have an undergraduate section.\n\n\nVII. Role of Graduate Employees\nIf you are concurrently taking any courses with the graduate employee\n(GE) assigned to this course, please let the instructor know. The GE\nwill not be involved with any review of assignments for students in this\ncourse who are taking other courses concurrently.\n\n\nVIII. Student Engagement Inventory\nGraduate students are expected to perform work of high quality and\nquantity, typically with forty hours of student engagement for each\nstudent credit hour. For this course, the following table shows the\nnumber of hours a typical student would expect to spend in each of the\nfollowing activities:\nEducational activity\nHours\nExplanatory comments\nClass attendance\n30\nThree hours per week over 10 weeks\nClass reading and prep\n30\nIncludes reading and review of slides\nAssignments\n24\nThree assignments taking 8 hours each (on avg.)\nQuizzes\n5\n1 hour per quiz (40 min preparation, 20 min completing quiz)\nLab attendance\n10\nOne hour-long lab per week over 10 weeks\nFinal project\n21\nIncludes familiarization with data, data analysis, preparation of\ngraphics and writing\nTotal hours\n120\n\n\n\nIX. Attendance and Absence Guidelines\nAttendance is required. In-person attendance at our scheduled class\nmeetings is expected and is integral to success in the course. In the\ncase of unavoidable absence, students must inform the instructor as\nearly as possible to discuss make-up work. If you need accommodation\nrelated to disability, you can request those by working with the\nAccessible Education Center (https://aec.uoregon.edu).\n\n\nX. Expected Classroom Behavior\nMinimally, we follow the Golden Rule of treating others as we wish to\nbe treated. We must also attend to equity concerns and understand that\neach of us has a unique experience and we vary in our values and\nexpectations.\n\n\nXI. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nIt is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value\nequity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for\nall students. To do so requires that we:\nrespect the dignity and essential worth of all\nindividuals.\npromote a culture of respect throughout the University\ncommunity.\nrespect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.\nreject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any\nkind.\npractice personal and academic integrity and expect it from\nothers.\npromote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is\nthe lifeblood of the university.\nIn this course, class discussions, projects/activities and\nassignments will challenge students to think critically about and be\nsensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity,\nnationality, documentation, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic\nbackground, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and\nother cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged\nto develop or expand their respect and understanding of such\ndifferences.\nMaintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students\nfeel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences,\nideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the\nresponsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or\ndiminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This\nmeans that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or\notherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that\nstudents must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s\ncomments.\n\n\nXII. Using Pronouns and Personal Preference\nThe College of Education is always working to include and engage\neveryone. One way we can do this is to share your pronouns, or the words\nyou want to be called when people aren’t using your name. Like names,\npronouns are an important part of how we identify that deserves to be\nrespected. And we recognize that assuming someone’s gender can be\nhurtful, especially to members of our community who are transgender,\ngenderqueer, or non-binary. As a community, we are all learning together\nabout the importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans\ncommunity on campus. Please discuss the pronouns you wish to be used\nwith your professor to help them be aware of how to address you\nrespectfully. Please visit this university website for more information:\nhttps://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns\n\n\nXIII. Accessible Education\nThe University of Oregon is working to create inclusive learning\nenvironments. Please notify me if there are aspects of the instruction\nor design of this course that result in disability-related barriers to\nyour participation. Participation includes access to lectures, web-based\ninformation, in-class activities, and exams. The Accessible Education\nCenter (http://aec.uoregon.edu/) works with students to provide\nan instructor notification letter that outlines accommodations and\nadjustments to class design that will enable better access. Contact the\nAccessible Education Center in 360 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or uoaec@uoregon.edu for\nassistance with access or disability-related questions or concerns.\n\n\nXIV. Accommodation for Religious Observances\nThe university makes reasonable accommodations, upon request, for\nstudents who are unable to attend a class for religious obligations or\nobservance reasons, in accordance with the university discrimination\npolicy which says “Any student who, because of religious beliefs, is\nunable to attend classes on a particular day shall be excused from\nattendance requirements and from any examination or other assignment on\nthat day. The student shall make up the examination or other assignment\nmissed because of the absence.” To request accommodations for this\ncourse for religious observance, visit the Office of the Registrar’s\nwebsite (https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/religious-observances)\nand complete and submit to the instructor the “Student Religious\nAccommodation Request” form prior to the end of the second week of the\nterm.\n\n\nXV. Mental Health and Wellness\nLife at college can be very complicated. Students often feel\noverwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with\nrelationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If\nyou’re facing such challenges, you don’t need to handle them on your\nown–there’s help and support on campus.\nAs your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I\nwill express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to\nresources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the\ndetails of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I\ncare and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to\ndo—for yourself and those you care about.\nUniversity Health Services help students cope with difficult emotions\nand life stressors. If you need general resources on coping with stress\nor want to talk with another student who has been in the same place as\nyou, visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and\nget help from one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. Find\nout more at health.uoregon.edu/ducknest.\nUniversity Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff\nmembers to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide\nidentity-based support. All clinical services are free and confidential.\nFind out more at https://counseling.uoregon.edu/ or by calling\n541-346-3227 (anytime UCS is closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis\nLine is available by calling this same number).\n\n\nXVI.

All students are expected\nto contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for\nevery member of the class.\nClass rosters are provided to instructors with students’ legal names.\nPlease let me know if the name or pronouns I have for you are not\naccurate.

Students are\nprohibited from committing or attempting to commit any act that\nconstitutes academic misconduct. By way of example, students should not\ngive or receive (or attempt to give or receive) unauthorized help on\nassignments or examinations without express permission from the\ninstructor.
