# Introductions

- Name, preferred pronouns, and program


- Research/practice interests


- What you would like to get out of this course

---
# EDUC quant sequence


--
- Goal: Develop the foundational quantitative skills necessary for applied data analysis

 + Not all the skills you'll need are covered, particularly for those interested in analysis-heavy positions or becoming an applied quantitative doctoral-level researcher


--
- Goal: Understand the (in)appropriate application of those skills

 + Understand the capabilities, limitations, and misuses of common quantitative methods, and be able to evaluate the credibility of published research that uses these methods


--
- Courses in the EDUC methods sequence share the following principles:

 + Analysis follows research design, which emerges from substantive questions
 + Students learn statistical analysis by doing statistical analysis
 + Create an inclusive, supportive environment in which we learn from each other
 + Balance support and academic stretch across a variety of levels of prior experience and comfort with quantitative analysis


---
# EDUC 645 assumptions

The assumption is that you're beginning this course with the ability to:


--
- Create an RStudio project, read in a dataset in csv format, filter rows, select columns, understand structure of data, recode variables, assess missingness, and calculate summary statistics for continuous and categorical variables in the R programming language


--
- Create simple visualizations describing categorical and continuous variables, and their relationships with each other in R


--
- State a quantitative research question and its corresponding null hypothesis


--
- Articulate the conceptual basis for a null-hypothesis significance test


--
- Conduct a one-sample `\(t\)`-test and fit a simple (bivariate) linear regression model



--
See [EDUC 641 data management guide](https://daviddliebowitz.github.io/EDUC641_22F/data_management.html) for data management pointers


---
# Goals of EDUC 645

In this intermediate course, we will focus on using analytic models and strategies for examining data that have: 


--
- a dichotomous outcome


--
- a count outcome


--
- a nested structure


--
- missingness


--
During Unit 1, we'll also talk briefly about tools that give us information about how consistently the assessment tools we use are measuring our outcome. 


--
  + Are students with the same depression severity responding similarly to our depression scale?


--
Finally, at the end of the course, we'll spend some time critically appraising published studies that use course methods.


--
**.blue[What's the real-world applicability of the methods we'll discuss?]**

---
# Applications

- Sometimes the outcomes we're interested in don't describe a range or degree of something, like severity of depression symptoms or extent of classroom engagement. 


--
- Instead, an outcome might be the presence or the absence of a characteristic, or correspond to a state of being.


--
  + Among adolescents, is more severe depression associated with a greater likelihood of being *absent* (versus *present*) from class?


--
- Alternatively, the outcome may be a count of events over a period of time, which can also be described as a *rate*.


--
  + Among adolescents, is more severe depression associated with a *higher number of absences during the school year*?


--
**.blue[Can you think of other examples of these kinds of outcomes?]**


---
# Applications, cont.

- For either of the questions on the last slide, we would expect students to differ from one another in number of absences. But, what if the classroom that students are assigned to also makes a difference in absences? 


--
  + Perhaps some teachers are more effective than others, or students in some classes, on average, have less parental support and engagement. 


--
  + Classrooms could also differ in the number of absences simply due to chance.


--
- In this situation, variation in absences occurs at two levels: students vary in absences, and the average number of absences in each classroom also varies. In other words, students' variation in the outcome is *nested* within variation in the outcome across classrooms. 


--
**.blue[Imagine we ran an analysis to address the question *Does depression severity predict the number of days a student is absent from class?*]**


--
**.blue[In our data, absences varied among students and also widely between classrooms, but we used an analysis that didn't differentiate those 2 levels of variation (i.e., it attributed all the variation to students). Would our results give an accurate picture of the relationship between depression and absences?]**

---
# Course structure

1. Two (2) weekly 1.5-hour lectures will introduce concepts in interactive lectures, discussion and activities. Readings are intended to supplement material from lectures.

2. Two (2) **.blue[optional, ungraded]** weekly labs for support with R programming and assignments. Each lab will cover identical material.

3. Three (3) quizzes on Canvas, each worth a trivial amount of points (5% of grade). 

4. Three (3) unit assignments (15% each) + final project (25% of grade)


--
| Unit  | Week(s) | Topic
|----------------------------------------------------
| 1     | 1-3     | Outcome Types + Data Structures and Validity 
| 2     | 4-7     | Dichotomous Outcomes
| 3     | 8-10    | Count Outcomes


--
Detailed schedule, slides, data, and assignments are on the [course website](https://uo-educ-quant.github.io/645/index.html). Lectures will be recorded and available on the Panopto Recordings tab on Canvas.
