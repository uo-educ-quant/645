# Binary Data

- You've learned to model continuous outcomes with linear regression models BUT there are many instances when we are interested in the probability of an outcome. How do we handle these sort of data?

--

- What about when you are interested in probability, an outcome related to binary data? (e.g., yes/no)  
    • Ex. probability of group given individual traits, probability of needs, etc.
    
--

- How are they different? Why can't we apply the same method?

---
# Binary Outcomes
- Outcomes with a yes/no or 0/1 response

--

- Examples:  
  - Depression or not?  
  - Vaccinated or not?  

--
	
- Proportion vs. Odds

---
# Proportion
- Description 1:

---
# Odds
Odds of an event: the probability of 'yes' divided by the probability of 'no'
- $Odds = p/1(1-p)$

--

What are the odds of getting Tails when tossing a fair coin?

--

What are the odds of getting a 6 when tossing a fair dice?

# Odds and Probability

As the probability of an event increases, so do the odds

[insert data visualization comparing trajectories]

???
- As the probability of an event increases, so do the odds
- Odds increase *almost* exponentially as the probability increases

---
# Binary Outcome and Binary Predictor
- Measures of Association
	• Difference in probabilities = p1-p2
			- If difference in probabilities of the outcome across the categories is NOT 0, then predictor is associated with the outcome

--

	• Odds ratio (OR) = odds on category of predictor/odds other category of predictor
			- If OR is NOT 1, then predictor is associated with the outcome

???
- If the difference in probabilities of the outcome across the categories is NOT 0, there is an association between the outcome and the predictor

- If the OR is NOT 1, then there is an association between the predictor and the outcome

Odds 
- One way to quantify a goalkeeper's performance. 
We see that the odds of a goal scored on a penalty kick are better when the goalkeeper's team is behind than when it is not behind (i.e., better odds of scoring for the shooter when the shooter's team is ahead). 

We can compare these odds by calculating the __odds ratio__ \index{odds ratio} (OR), 11/3.61 or 3.05, 

which tells us that the *odds* of a successful penalty kick are 3.05 times higher when the shooter's team is leading.

In our example, it is also possible to estimate the probability of a goal, $p$, for either circumstance. When the goalkeeper's team is behind, the probability of a successful penalty kick is $p$ = 22/24 or 0.833. We can see that the ratio of the probability of a goal scored divided by the probability of no goal is $(22/24)/(2/24)=22/2$ or 11, the odds we had calculated above. The same calculation can be made when the goalkeeper's team is not behind. In general, we now have several ways of finding the odds of success under certain circumstances:

$\[Odds} = \frac{\# \textrm{successes}}{\# \textrm{failures}}=
\frac{\# \textrm{successes}/n}{\# \textrm{failures}/n}=
\frac{p}{1-p}.\]$

Generalized linear models (GLMs)
- are a way in which to model a variety of different types of responses.
- we apply the general results of GLMs to the specific application of binomial responses. 

$Y$ = the number scored out of $n$ penalty kicks. 
The parameter, $p$, is the probability of a score on a single penalty kick. 

Recall that the theory of GLMs is based on the unifying notion of the one-parameter exponential family form:

\begin{equation*}
f(y;\theta)=e^{[a(y)b(\theta)+c(\theta)+d(y)]}
\end{equation*}

To see that we can apply the general approach of GLMs \index{generalized linear models (GLMs)} to binomial responses, we first write an expression for the probability of a binomial response and then use a little algebra to rewrite it until we can demonstrate that it, too, can be written in one-parameter exponential family form with $\theta = p$. This will provide a way in which to specify the canonical link and the form for the model. Additional theory allows us to deduce the mean, standard deviation, and more from this form.

If $Y$ follows a binomial distribution with $n$ trials and probability of success $p$, we can write:

\begin{align*}
P(Y=y)&= \binom{n}{y}p^y(1-p)^{(n-y)} \\
      &=e^{y\log(p) + (n-y)\log(1-p) + \log\binom{n}{y}}
\end{align*}

However, this probability mass function is not quite in one-parameter exponential family form. Note that there are two terms in the exponent which consist of a product of functions of $y$ and $p$. So more simplification is in order:

\begin{equation*}
P(Y=y) = e^{y\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) + n\log(1-p)+ \log\binom{n}{y}}
\end{equation*}

The one-parameter exponential family form for binomial responses shows that the  canonical link is $\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$. Thus, GLM theory suggests that constructing a model using the logit, the log odds of a score, as a linear function of covariates is a reasonable approach.

# Logistic Regression

binary (0 or 1) response (Y) and a single continuous predictor (X).  The solid line is a linear regression fit with least squares to model the probability of a success (Y=1) for a given value of X.  With a binary response, the line doesn't fit the data well, and it produces predicted probabilities below 0 and above 1.  On the other hand, the logistic regression fit (dashed curve) with its typical "S" shape follows the data closely and always produces predicted probabilities between 0 and 1.  For these and several other reasons detailed in this chapter, we will focus on the following model for logistic regression with binary or binomial responses:

\begin{equation*}
log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_i
\end{equation*}
where the observed values $Y_i \sim$ binomial with $p=p_i$ for a given $x_i$ and $n=1$ for binary responses.

# Assumptions
- The outcome (Y) is discrete (0/1 variable)
- There must be enough responses in every category
- Linearity in the logit scale  - X's must be linearly related to logit(Y)
- Absence of multicollinearity
- No outliers
- Independence of (X,Y)'s
