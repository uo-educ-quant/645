# Roadmap

# Goals for the unit
Measurement

Validity

Reliability

# Measurement

Our ability to link theoretical concepts and observable responses.

Good measurement is indispensable.
Allow for the testing of a theory or its parts
Ensure inferences are accurate and correct
---
# Classical Measurement Theory

X = T + E

X is the observed score
T is the True Score
E is the Error associated with Measurement 
---
# Measurement Error
Random error
Chance factors confounding a measure’s true score
Random error is inversely related to a measure’s reliability

Non-random error
Systematic bias in measurement
Non-random error influences the validity of a measure

---
# Properties of Measurement
Reliability
Internal reliability
Temporal reliability

Validity
Face validity
Criterion-related validity
Concurrent validity
Predictive validity
Content validity
Construct validity

---
# Reliability
Consistency of measurement
Computed by taking the ratio of the true score variance and the observed variance:
[ insert formula ]

As VAR(T) increases, so does Reliability.

---
# Measuring Reliability
Test-Retest method

Alternative form method

Split-halves method

Internal consistency method

---
# Test-retest
Examines temporal stability of a measure. May be influenced by the time between assessments. 
Always provide details regarding the time between assessments in a study. 
Practice effect bias.

Individuals should not have “changed” in ways that would bias the test-retest assessment. Any difference in the assessment could be non-random error and reduce the reliability.

Only appropriate when the individual has not changed as a result of the first test, and/or the length of time between assessments has diminished the likelihood of practice effect bias.

---
# Alternative Form
Developer must create two separate tests examining the same domain, yet use different content.  

This method provides a test of equivalences.
If possible, both versions are administered as closely in time as possible (e.g., same day). 
Avoid order effects by randomizing sequence among participants.

Care must be taken. Tests will never be perfectly equivalent, particularly when the measure is assessing abstract elements.

---
# Splot Halves
Offer the assessment yet divide (“split-half method”) the items at random.  

Split in two comparable sets, you can compare the reliability of one set to the other.  

In splitting the measure, reliability will be lowered artificially. It is important to adjust the reliability estimate using the Spearman-Brown adjustment:
			radjusted = N*rsh/[1 + (N-1)rsh]

---
# Internal Consistency
Assessment of how well a set of variables correlate with each other (“hang together”).

Internal consistency estimates are sensitive to:
Missing data
Unidirection of variables
Number of items

---
# Cronbach's Alpha

[ insert formula ]

k = number of items included in scale analysis
s2i = variance of scores for each item
s2 = variance of all scores in the scale
Range = 0-1

---
# Standards for reliability
Cronbach's alpha 
       α ≥ .9 Excellent 
.9 > α ≥ .8 Good 
.8 > α ≥ .7 Acceptable 
.7 > α ≥ .6 Questionable 
.6 > α ≥ .5 Poor 
.5 > α Unacceptable

---
# Reliability: KR-20

Items are dichotomous (0 or 1)
Kuder-Richardson formula number 20


k = number of items included in scale analysis
pi = proportion responding “positively”
qi  = 1 – pi
s2 = variance of all scores in the scale

---
# Attentuation Correction
Estimates the correlation between X & Y, assuming perfect measurement.

Observed correlation over the SQRT of the (Reliability of X*Reliability of Y). 

---
# Validity
Face validity: Measure seems to assess domain

Criterion-related validity
Concurrent validity: Measure is correlated with behavior
Predictive validity: Measure is predictive of behavior

Content validity
Measurement includes holistic elements of domain

Construct validity
Measurement relates to other theoretically-derived measures
---
# Above and beyond: Factor analysis
Statistical method to uncover clusters (factors) of interrelated variables.

Each factor represents items that are highly correlated with each other.

The higher the inter-correlation of the item, the higher the factor loading of the item on a given factor.
