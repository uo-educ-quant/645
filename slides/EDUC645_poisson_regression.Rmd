# Motivating Example

### Important R packages used in this unit

 - AER [Kleiber and Zeileis 2022](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AER/index.html), [vignette here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AER/vignettes/AER.pdf), which stands for "Applied Econometrics with R"
   - dispersiontest() function tests the null hypothesis of equidispersion in Poisson regressions against the alternative of overdispersion and/or underdispersion

### The dataset 

**Dataset: ceps_sch.csv**

```{r}
ceps <- rio::import(here::here("data", "ceps_sch.csv")) 

ceps %>% 
  filter(row_number() < 6) %>% 
  kable()
```

This dataset was drawn from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), China’s first nationally representative, longitudinal survey of middle school students. CEPS first wave was conducted during school year 2013-2014 and a stratified, four-step random sampling procedure was implemented to draw a random sample of middle schools (N=112) from the nation and collect rich data from school administrators, teachers, students, and parents. This school-level dataset is limited to 45 schools that have eight teacher participants and no missing values on any key variables. Our primary goal with this dataset is to investigate the school-level factors associated with teacher job satisfaction that is measured by the count of teachers who feel satisfied with their job and their school. 

 - *schids*, school identifier
 - *njobsatis*, number of teachers who answered yes to the question of whether to choose being a teacher if given other job options
 - *nschsatis*, number of teachers who answered yes to the question of whether to choose the current school if being allowed to move to other schools
 - *rural*, categorical measure of proportion of rural students in school; 1=lower than 25%, 2=25% to 60%, 3=60% to 80%, 4=higher than 80%
 - *clsize*, average class size
 - *computer*, number of computers available to students
 - *ctyeduz*, neighborhood average years of education (standardized)

---
# Summary statistics 

```{r}
ceps %>% 
  select(-schids) %>%
  select(njobsatis, nschsatis, everything()) %>% 
  mutate(rural = factor(rural, levels = c(1,2,3,4), labels = c("lower than 25%", "25% to 60%", "60% to 80%", "higher than 80%"))) %>% 
  tbl_summary(
    type = list(c("clsize", "ctyeduz", "computer") ~ "continuous",
                c("njobsatis", "nschsatis", "rural") ~ "categorical"),
    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({min}, {max})",
                       all_categorical() ~ "{n} / {N} ({p}%)"),
    label = list(njobsatis ~ "Number of teachers satisfied with job",
                 nschsatis ~ "Number of teachers satisfied with school",
                 rural ~ "Proportion of rural students",
                 clsize ~ "Average class size",
                 computer ~ "Number of computers",
                 ctyeduz ~ "Neighborhood average years of education (standardized)")
    )
```

# Visualizations

## The two teacher satisfaction measures

Job satisfaction:

```{r}
ceps %>% 
  ggplot(aes(njobsatis)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Number of teachers satisfied with job",
       y = "Number of schools") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(accuracy = 1))
```

---
# Visualizations

Satisfaction towards school:

```{r}
ceps %>% 
  ggplot(aes(nschsatis)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "cadetblue") +
  labs(x = "Number of teachers satisfied with school",
       y = "Number of schools") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(accuracy = 1))
```
Henceforce investigating job satisfaction (njobsatis). We may use job satisfaction (njobsatis) as outcome in the class and school satisfaction (nschsatis) in the lab or assignment.

---
# Poisson regression

Research inquiry: relationship between class size and job satisfaction

## Why simple linear regression is not ideal for Poisson data

Do you think a linear fitted line is a good way to describe the relationship between these two variables?

```{r}
ceps %>% 
  ggplot(aes(clsize, njobsatis)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", alpha = 0, color = "orangered") +
  labs(x = "Average class size",
       y = "Number of teachers satisfied with job") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(accuracy = 1))
```

---

An important reason why a linear least squares regression model doesn't work for Poisson data is the violation of equal variance assumption, see the plot below:

```{r}
ols <- lm(njobsatis ~ clsize, ceps)

plot(density(resid(ols)))
```

---

```{r}
# try to replicate Figure 4.1 in textbook (in progress)

# get the residuals of linear regression
ceps$residuals_ols <- residuals(ols)
# get the residuals of poisson regression
ceps$residuals_glm <- ceps$njobsatis - 0.1 * ceps$clsize
```

---
# Poission regression assumptions

First, the number of teachers satisfied with their job still demonstrate Poisson distribution when grouped by class size:

```{r}
# table(ceps$clsize)
cuts = cut(ceps$clsize,
           breaks=c(10, 30, 50, 70))
data.frame(cuts, ceps) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(njobsatis)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "royalblue") +
  facet_wrap(cuts) +
  labs(x = "Number of teachers satisfied with job",
       y = "Number of schools")
```

---
# Poission regression assumptions

```{r}
data.frame(cuts, ceps) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(njobsatis, fill = cuts)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Number of teachers satisfied with job",
       fill = "Groups of class size") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

---
# Poission regression assumptions
Second, the mean equals to variance assumption for Poisson random variables are largely met:

```{r}
data.frame(cuts, ceps) %>% 
  group_by(cuts) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(njobsatis),
            var = var(njobsatis),
            n = n()) %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Class size groups", "Mean", "Variance", "n")) 
```

---
# Poission regression assumptions

More formally, the dispersion test:

```{r}
dispersiontest(glm(njobsatis ~ clsize, family = poisson, ceps))
```

---
# Poission regression assumptions

Third, check for the linearity assumption:

```{r}
ceps %>% 
  group_by(clsize) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(njobsatis),
            logmean = log(mean),
            n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(clsize, logmean)) +
  geom_point(color = "grey60") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", size = 1.2, color = "firebrick", alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "Average class size",
       y = "Log of the empirical mean of number of teacher satisfied")
```

---
# Poission regression assumptions

#### Poisson regression estimator

```{r}
m1 <- glm(njobsatis ~ clsize, family = poisson, ceps)
m2 <- glm(njobsatis ~ clsize + rural + computer + ctyeduz, family = poisson, ceps)
```

```{r}
list(m1, m2) %>% 
  huxreg()
```

Compared to OLS estimators:

```{r}
m3 <- lm(njobsatis ~ clsize, ceps)
m4 <- lm(njobsatis ~ clsize + rural + computer + ctyeduz, ceps)

huxreg(
  "Poisson" = m1,
  "Poisson (covariates)" = m2,
  "OLS" = m3,
  "OLS (covariates)" = m4,
  coefs = c("Average class size" = "clsize",
            "Proportion of rural students" = "rural",
            "Number of computers" = "computer",
            "Neigbhorhood education (standardized)" = "ctyeduz")
  )
```

# Poission regression assumptions

#### Model fit

```{r}
anova(m1, m2, test = "Chisq")
```

# Count Data

What about examining predictors of outcomes related to a rate or number of events:
* the number of times an event occurs during a given timeframe?
* the number of people in line at the grocery store?

These kinds of questions draw from count data
* Discrete data with non-negative integer values that count a particular outcome according to a defined parameter of time/space

**How does this definition differ from binomial data?**

# Poisson Distribution

* A discrete probability distribution is used to describe the off occurrence of unlikely events in a large number of independent trials

* Poisson is a good approximation to the binomial distribution when the probability is small and the number of trials is large

* It expresses the probability of a number of events occurring in a fixed period of time if these events occur with a known average rate and are independent of the time since the last event
Examine if we want to know "how many of X in what amount of time"

# Poisson Vs. Normal Distribution

|Poisson Distribution |	Normal Distribution|
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
|Used for count or rate data |	Used for continuous variables |
|Skewed by values of lambda	 | Bell-shaped curve symmetric around the mean.|
|Variance = Mean	| Variance and mean are different parameters; mean, median and mode are equal |

---
# Poisson Distribution: Dispersion


---
# Time

Time: normalizes the count variable that is observed
- Number of accidents per day, per year, per week
- Units of time, length of time, or other unit
Number of accidents per mile, students per district

---
# Rate

Rate = # of events/unit of time

Sometimes rescaled so that the number of cases per unit is a whole number
Rate $\neq$ probability

|       |Rate                 |Probability|
|-------|---------------------|-----------|
| Units |Include unit of time |Do not have a unit|
| Range of values |Can be >1            |Between 0 and 1|

---
# Comparing Rates

Suppose we want to compare rate of Y at two different sites (X groups) 
We have to assume that incidents occurred at similar rates throughout the year
Typically organize information about counts and time in a table:

|	       |Count|Time |
|--------|-----|-----|
|Group 1 | N1	 |T1   |
|Group 2 | N2	 |T2   |

---
# Steps to comparing rates:

### 1. Calculate rates in both groups
$$Rate = \frac{n_{events}}{unit_{time}}$$

### 2. Calculate Rate Ratio (RR)
$$RR = \frac{Rate_1}{Rate_2}$$

### 3. Conduct test of hypothesis to see is RR $\neq$ 1

$$H_0: RR = 1$$
$$H_a: RR \neq 1$$

$$z = \frac{ln(RR)}{\sqrt{(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}}$$
* Get $p$-value
* Get CI for RR
*	Draw conclusions

# Poisson Regression V. Logistic Regression

- Like logistic regression, the underlying mathematics and underlying probability distribution theory are different from OLS regression
  - Relies on the same parameters of the GLM

* Logistic regression models the **log odds of _an event_**

* Poisson regression models the **natural log of _an expected count_**
  - Negative predicted values non-issue (negative values correspond to expected counts between 0 and 1)

---
# Poisson Regression 

* Helps us analyze both count data and rate data 
  - Can determine which explanatory variables (X values) have an effect on a given response variable (Y value, the count or a rate). 
  - For example, school districts could use to better predict the number of students who receive free/reduced lunch.

---
# Interpretation of Model Parameters

$$\log(\lambda) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X$$
$\lambda$: Average number of occurrences per unit of time or space, as a function of one or more covariates

$\beta_0$: log of the rate for the reference group

$\beta_1$: log of the rate ratio between a given group and the reference group

$X$:predictor variable

---
# Rates Accounting for other factor(s)
Poisson regression allows us to study how rates of an even vary by characteristics of the groups of interest
$$\ln(Rate) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X$$

- $E[Y]$: expected number of events

- $X$: predictor variable

- $\beta_0$: natural log of the rate for the reference group

- $\beta_1$: natural log of the rate ratio between a given group and the reference group
	- Similar to the logistic regression where the coefficient was the natural log of the OR

--

### alternatively written...

$$\ln(\frac{E[Y]}{Time}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X$$

$$\ln(E[Y]) - \ln(Time) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X$$

$$\ln(E[Y]) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \ln(Time)$$

- $\ln(Time)$: *offset variable* takes into account the rate of change over time

---
# Interpreting Coefficients
Poisson regression coefficient represents the *change in response corresponding to a one unit difference in the corresponding predictor.* 

???
Like other regression coefficients, a Poisson regression coefficient represents the change in response corresponding to a one unit difference in the corresponding predictor. Here, the response is expected (natural) logged count.

---
# Assumptions

The outcome (Y) is a count (positive integer)
* Ex. the number of people in a subgroup of a population who have a learning disorder
Requires a unit of time:
* E.g., number of accidents per day, number of exposed per year

Count data can also be expressed as rate data
* the number of times an event occurs within a timeframe can be expressed as:
- raw count (i.e. “In a day, we eat three meals”)
- rate (“We eat at a rate of 0.125 meals per hour”)

* Response Variable: The response variable is a count per unit of time or space, described by a Poisson distribution.
* Independence: The observations must be independent of one another.
* Mean=Variance By definition, the mean of a Poisson random variable must be equal to its variance.
* Linearity: The log of the mean rate, log(λ), must be a linear function of x.
