### Software preparation

If you haven't done so, finish the steps below:

1. Download [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and install
2. Download [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) and install
3. (Optional) Setting up Git and Github ([tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com))
   - Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install
   - Create your account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
4. Check for the status of your software, run the following code in your RStudio console (you don't need to keep everything up-to-date but these information will set you off for a good start if you encounter software/package issues)
   - *version$version.string*
     - check whether you have the most recent version of R
   - *RStudio.Version()$version*
     - check whether you have the most recent version of RStudio
   - *update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)*
     - check whether you've updated all your R packages 

### R project preparation

Many ways to do this, here is one working for our class:

1. In your RStudio, create a new project
   - If you don't have a collaborator and don't need version control, [tutorial here](https://bookdown.org/daniel_dauber_io/r4np_book/starting-your-r-projects.html)
   - If you need version control, [Dr. Grant McDermott's lecture](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/02-git/02-Git.html#12) may be the best way to learn
2. Organize your project  
   - Go to your project root folder, create some subfolders (data, files, archive, etc.) to maintain the cleanness of your root folder 
     - the data folder especially makes your life easier
   - Download your datasets and store them in the data folder you just created

### R Project workflow

1. Find the .Rproj file in your R project root folder and open it in RStudio
2. Create any new files, here we take an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) file (an .Rmd file) as example
3. In your .Rmd file, create the following code chunks:
   - the chunk to set up global chunk options used through out the whole file 
     - using command *knitr::opts_chunk$set()*
     - check [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) for what these options mean
     - any options in a chunk label will overwrite the global options for that specific chunk
   - the chunk to load packages
     - call one package by using command *library()*
     - call multiple packages by using the command *pacman::p_load* 
   - the chunk to set global theme 
     - using the command *ggplot2::theme_set()* to set global theme for your plots
   - the chunk to read in dataset
     - all datasets used in this course can be loaded using command *rio::import(here::here("data", "your dataset"))*
     - for more information on how to load different types of data, see a brief tutorial [here](https://www.statmethods.net/input/importingdata.html)
   - other code chunks for managing, visualizing, describing, and modeling data
4. Knit your .Rmd file and obtain .html, .doc, .pdf, or other types of files as outputs ([see all formats](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html))

### R helps

1. RStudio built in help documents
   - for documentations on packages/functions, using command *?* or *help()*
   - for scanning through documents on all the packages installed, using command *??* or *help.search()*
2. Did you form a habit of asking https://www.rstudio.com/resources/ rather than Google for R-related questions?
   - Very handy [cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
   - Free [textbooks for all levels of R learners](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/books/) 
   - [Finding your way to R](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/)
   - and so much more
3. For specific questions and debugging, try [RStudio Support](https://support.rstudio.com) and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
